I've read that they are very reliable and hold their value well. My budget is probably going to allow for a 98-99 and I was wondering if it's worth buying a car that's almost 3-4 years old.

It's one of the best sedans on the market with great handling and one of the best V6 engines around, a 3.5L DOHC producing 215HP. The deals should be great this year as it's the last on for Intrigue and the warrany on them has been extended to 5 years. The car is recommended by most magazines (including Consumer Reports), but is unfortunately over looked by most consumers. It is the sleeper of all sleepers on the market in my opinion.    \n",

My 95Q was pig in snow, but I'm sure 2002Q is a world away from that. I've heard Audi has some QC problems, but I like their maintenance being included. I'm a happy Lexus driver. The Q appears to offer the most for the $$. Will lease and in this economy, I would think I could command an attractive package. Can I go wrong with any of the 4? Am I missing something?    \n",

If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other.    \n",

Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for.    \n",

I've read that they are very reliable and hold their value well. My budget is probably going to allow for a 98-99 and I was wondering if it's worth buying a car that's almost 3-4 years old. Any suggestions or comments would help a lot.willow25    \n",

It's one of the best sedans on the market with great handling and one of the best V6 engines around, a 3.5L DOHC producing 215HP. The deals should be great this year as it's the last on for Intrigue and the warrany on them has been extended to 5 years. The car is recommended by most magazines (including Consumer Reports), but is unfortunately over looked by most consumers. It is the sleeper of all sleepers on the market in my opinion.    \n",
       "3  Am looking at 1 of 4 choices to replace my 99GS400. I've read everything here and on other forums and have seen much conflicting info:4 options:Lexus LS430 with custom/luxury packageInfiniti Q45 with premium pckgAudi A-6 4.2 loaded Audi A-8 not stripped, but not loadedChicago winters--had Blizzaks on the GS--worked fine. My 95Q was pig in snow, but I'm sure 2002Q is a world away from that. I've heard Audi has some QC problems, but I like their maintenance being included. I'm a happy Lexus driver. The Q appears to offer the most for the $$. Will lease and in this economy, I would think I could command an attractive package. Can I go wrong with any of the 4? Am I missing something?    \n",

If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other.    \n",

Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for.    \n",

I am just so damn used to longevity in all my cars that I think anything less would make me unhappy in the long run. I don't have the patience or money to repair stuff anymore than I have to... and since I have driven beaters into the ground, I don't care about aesthetics as much as durability. That said if no Toyota or Honda is a good fit for the husband than we will look at an Optima CPO. We're heading to Carmax today to just get in a bunch of cars and see what kind of room there is in the front driver seat for him, 6 foot 4, and me who will be the main driver. \\nDid you get a car yet? If not and are still considering the Optima, JD Power just ranked the 2018 Optima the #1 mid-sized car in its latest Vehicle Dependability Study. And Kia was the highest-ranked mass-market brand overall, behind only Lexus and Porsche. FYI the 2018 Sonata was the #2 mid-sized car.https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-us-vehicle-dependability-study-vds</td>\n",

It's one of the best sedans on the market with great handling and one of the best V6 engines around, a 3.5L DOHC producing 215HP. The deals should be great this year as it's the last on for Intrigue and the warrany on them has been extended to 5 years. The car is recommended by most magazines (including Consumer Reports), but is unfortunately over looked by most consumers. It is the sleeper of all sleepers on the market in my opinion.    \n",

My 95Q was pig in snow, but I'm sure 2002Q is a world away from that. I've heard Audi has some QC problems, but I like their maintenance being included. I'm a happy Lexus driver. The Q appears to offer the most for the $$. Will lease and in this economy, I would think I could command an attractive package. Can I go wrong with any of the 4? Am I missing something?    \n",

If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other.    \n",

How are you ever going to get meaningful data from a make that sells so few cars?Name one other organization that actually compiles data or surveys, long term. I don't think there are any. \\nOh, you can't. But that's my point when folks throw old thinking around like \"Honda and Toyota are the only reliable cars.\" It just isn't that simple. I would say HyunKia are just as reliable these days. Do I have proof? Nope. But nobody has proof to say otherwise. That's all I'm getting at. \\nI bet CR has a lot of surveys on those two makes. You might be right, and they could probably back it up.     \n",
       "4147  KamCottage said:Thank you backy. Since I first posted this question, I've come to realize, as mcdawgg said above, that I want a Toyota or Honda because of the reliability. I am just so damn used to longevity in all my cars that I think anything less would make me unhappy in the long run. I don't have the patience or money to repair stuff anymore than I have to... and since I have driven beaters into the ground, I don't care about aesthetics as much as durability. That said if no Toyota or Honda is a good fit for the husband than we will look at an Optima CPO. We're heading to Carmax today to just get in a bunch of cars and see what kind of room there is in the front driver seat for him, 6 foot 4, and me who will be the main driver. \\nDid you get a car yet? If not and are still considering the Optima, JD Power just ranked the 2018 Optima the #1 mid-sized car in its latest Vehicle Dependability Study. And Kia was the highest-ranked mass-market brand overall, behind only Lexus and Porsche. FYI the 2018 Sonata was the #2 mid-sized car.https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-us-vehicle-dependability-study-vds    \n",
