I'm buying a ""new"" car by the end of the year and my first choice is a Nissan Maxima. I've read that they are very reliable and hold their value well. My budget is probably going to allow for a 98-99 and I was wondering if it's worth buying a car that's almost 3-4 years old. Any suggestions or comments would help a lot.willow25 ",Posts: 2,Member

Buy a 2001/ 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue. It's one of the best sedans on the market with great handling and one of the best V6 engines around, a 3.5L DOHC producing 215HP. The deals should be great this year as it's the last on for Intrigue and the warrany on them has been extended to 5 years. The car is recommended by most magazines (including Consumer Reports), but is unfortunately over looked by most consumers. It is the sleeper of all sleepers on the market in my opinion.

Am looking at 1 of 4 choices to replace my 99GS400. I've read everything here and on other forums and have seen much conflicting info:4 options:Lexus LS430 with custom/luxury packageInfiniti Q45 with premium pckgAudi A-6 4.2 loaded Audi A-8 not stripped, but not loadedChicago winters--had Blizzaks on the GS--worked fine. My 95Q was pig in snow, but I'm sure 2002Q is a world away from that. I've heard Audi has some QC problems, but I like their maintenance being included. I'm a happy Lexus driver. The Q appears to offer the most for the $$. Will lease and in this economy, I would think I could command an attractive package. Can I go wrong with any of the 4? Am I missing something?

Generally a 3-4 year old car range is a good one because they are basically sound. If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other. ","Posts: 1,118",Member

Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

The only way to figure out what car you like is a test drive.

LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. ",Posts: 21,Member

My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom.

I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown ",Posts: 237,Member

Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years.

I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. ",Posts: 211,Member

all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. ","Posts: 1,078",Member

Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist.

After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience.

Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor.

Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking.

That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version?

sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership.

Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape.

The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! ",Posts: 101,Member

My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. ",Posts: 591,Member

To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)?

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty.

anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl ",Posts: 34,Member

I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think?

If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. ",Posts: 476,Member

November 2001 ",claywaterfill,"
If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. ",Posts: 534,Member

I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice.

The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire?

I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value.
As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. ",Posts: 438,Member

My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.

I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars.

I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then...

I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT.

If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind.

All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! ",Posts: 4,Member

IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. ","Posts: 1,078",Member

Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. ","Posts: 1,078",Member

Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html
The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. ",Posts: 591,Member

Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! ",Posts: 17,Member

The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). ",Posts: 539,Member

They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. ",Posts: 539,Member

fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely??

The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. ",Posts: 539,Member

don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted.

Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with.

I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. ",Posts: 539,Member

OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing!

Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). ",Posts: 539,Member

YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000.

I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though.

I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. ",Posts: 572,Member

Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree!

The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer.

There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something...

Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. ",Posts: 539,Member

From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more?

 I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. ",Posts: 534,Member

I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. ",Posts: 235,Member

I agree about the resale point. I do not think the Alero will lose much resale value since it shares a platform with the Grand Am. As far as the Malibu, which I am not a big fan of, the torquey 3.1 V-6 (standard)will leave an accord in the dust. Not that I like to burn rubber, but the malibu engine does make for surprisingly fun driving. Since I know people who own these cars, I am not concerned about their reliability...especially the Century. GM has made great strides in quality (except with the cavalier). Therefore, it comes down to everyday usefulness vs resale. When I need to carry a stroller, portacrib and other family essentials, I need room. In this area, the cars listed earlier give more real world bang (room and power)for the buck.If resale is the most important criteria, perhaps you should look at a Toyota? ",Posts: 235,Member

A few posts back someone wanted a good, reliable family sedan with V6 and good resale, but not much in the way of frills. He wanted to stay in the ballpark of an Accord LX V6. As oppossed to an Accord LX V6, people have suggested the Alero, Impala (base), Malibu, and 300M. They are fine cars, but he said reliable and good resale. A 2000 base Impala carries a trade in value of about $9566. A 2000 Malibu has a trade in of about $7417, an Alero GLS is worth $11,442, a 300M will trade in around $18,003. A 2000 Accord LX V6 has a trade in of about $14,107. The 300M carries a new MSRP of $28,340 and a new Accord LX V6 has a MSRP of $22,600. The 300M dropped $10,337 in value to the Accord's $8493. As far as reliable goes, the 2000 base Impala had no recalls, but 111 Technical Service Bulletins written for it. The 2001 Impala did better with still no recalls, and only 52 TSBs. The 2000 Malibu also had no recalls, but 104 TSBs. The 2001 Malibu improved to only 55 TSBs. The 2000 Alero GLS had no recalls and 115 TSBs. The 2001 Alero GLS improved to only 53 TSBs. The 2000 300M had 4 recalls and 36 TSBs. The 2001 300M improved to 1 recall and 20 TSBs. The 2000 Accord LX V6 did have 1 recall, but only 36 TSBs. The 2001 Accord LX V6 had no recalls and 6 TSBs. I guess Honda figured out what went wrong with the 2000 model. Again, I think these other cars are fine, but the Accord LX V6 definately meets his requirements better. ",Posts: 534,Member

I do agree, that for the money, the Accord is the best value around. Personally, I'd say the VTEC 4Cyl engine. It's several thousand less and has enough pickup for day to day driving.However, it's got one problem - even as Edmunds posted for several years  It's got the personality of Al Gore. My wife almost got one, but she just wanted something with more looks.If you are concerned primarily with resale, Honda or Acura are great. Toyota's not too bad, but the fully loaded Camrys go well over $30k nowadays.As for the discounts - there are all sorts of special promotions going on now for the M. $6-7k off sticker should be easy. You could prolly get up to $8k if you push it. Try some of the online places to get quotes - edmunds has one they link to. Plus the 0% is a big savings.I'd just recommend you drive one. You'll either hate it or love it  ",Posts: 328,Member

I am confused as to your obsession with the Accord. As I mentioned clearly in my post, Accord clearly has higher resale value than the cars I recommended. However, I have compared the cars side-by side and offered some real-world insight. I assume that is what the person with the question was looking for.For example, although I would not choose the Malibu, it is the closest match to the Accord. While it's resale is not as good, it also costs a cool $5,000 less (with rebate). For a person looking for a no-frills car, it saves you serious money up front and still offers superior cargo capacity (extra 3 Cubic feet). While the Malibu has fewer recalls and more TSB's than the Accord, I do not feel it is unreliable due to the experience of my peers. TSB's, while quantifiable, are not absolute indicators of your ownership experience. My 1993 Ranger had more TSB's than all of these vehicles, yet I have not been to the shop once.Personally, if reliability and resale statistics are your main criteria, I would take a Camry over the Accord. In addition to it's known quality and high resale, it offers more cargo capacity and better looks...all for the same price. ",Posts: 235,Member

I am the mother of two boys, ages 5 and 3. My mother just bought a Volvo S40 that has a very cool feature in it, integrated child booster seats. The rear seats fold up and eliminate the need for a booster seat for children who are too big for a car seat, but not large enough for adult size seat belts to be safe.I will be in the market for a new car in the near future (I currently drive a 1991 Honda Accord with 204,000 miles on it), and I want to know why more manufacturers don't offer this booster seat feature. Also, it doesn't appear as one of the options on the Edmunds' site for the 2002 Volvos. Does Volvo even still offer it? If the answers to these questions are no, does anyone have any idea why?

Alero: you said it had more cargo room than an Accord. That's true on paper, 14.1cu vs 14.6. On a recent trip to the airport, I easily fit all our luggage into the trunk of a Camry (14.1cu and nearly identical trunk design of the Accord). However, when we arrived my Alero rental wouldn't hold it all. If I remember correctly, the Alero had a very low shelf in the back and I couldn't stack my bags as I had in the Camry. Just a little tidbit because .5cu isn't much especially if the entire design isn't user friendly. I really liked the Alero though otherwise. It was loaded with leather, cd, moonroof, alloys. Nice car. Could've used some more oomph, but not bad. Kinda noisey, but alot of the roads in HI are grooved so it's hard to compare. Drove more like my wifes Galant V6 which is to say more entertaining than the Camry/Accord. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

You may want to check the Camry trunk size again. It is my understanding that the Camry trunk is 16.7 cubic feet. I didn't have a chance to check it today, but that's what I seem to remember.Was it an older Camry? I agree that .5 cubic feet is not any real difference.

It's a 97 Camry which is smaller than the newest one. The Alero is definetely smaller than my Camry and at the time I felt the trunk was much smaller than the Camrys as well. But then I looked at specs and as you noted they are very close as far as specs go. 4 bags went into the Camry trunk without thought, only 3 would go into the Alero. Had to stick one of the large ones in the back seat. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

The Alero is definitely smaller inside then the Accord but it's a smaller car overall. At least 5 inches shorter. Make sure you check out the backseat of the Alero. It has decent leg room but it's not the most comfortable seat and fitting a booster seat is ..well...try it for yourself. Going back to the original post of reliable no frills car. the Malibu is a viable option to the Accord. But if re-sale value is important then youhave to take the malibu, Alero, Impala and 300 M out of the equation. Their re-sale value is no where near the Accord or Camry. Quite honestly the Camry re-sale value took a hit last year. I think it had to do with leasing so many cars over the past 4 years that the used car market is loaded with them. In newspapers around here, the same year and mileage Camry's (LE vs. LX) are selling for about $1000 less then the Accords.Good luck with your purchase. ","Posts: 2,918",Member

In Canada they are building a Special Edition V6 with all the EX features except leather. Great lease rates at present and the Nisan dealer could not match the price.

Accords to me are very over-rated cars. In terms of performance (for a family sedan) there is nobody better than Maxima plus it is just as reliable as a Honda these days although none of these two are as reliable as a Toyota. (SIDE NOTE: I AM AN ACCORD OWNER). The other day I went to the REVIEWS section here on EDMUNDS and I found the 2000 Maxima out scored Accord in most categories. It would have came second or first (on the list of the TOP TEN FAMILY SEDANS) but it only got 58% of the Editors recommendation. WHY? ITS A MYSTERY TO ME. ",Posts: 5,Member

For that kind of driving (similar to my pattern) I recommend a Chevy Impala. Even the Base model, with the 3.4 is a great highway cruiser. The engine is quiet, has lots of power and is very reliable. You can't beat the highway MPG either, 34MPG or more. I drove this for 2 weeks in Atlanta during July...Air was on all the time and got 34 highway, 32 mixed driving.I wish my car had a tachometer because it seems like it is hardly running at 70+ MPH. Surprisingly, it is finally getting good reviews from various enthusiasts. For a small upgrade you can have the 3.8L engine. ",Posts: 235,Member

If you must pick from the cars listed, I'd take the Avalon too. I love the interior layout and it's a nice ride.However, try the Impala and I think you'll be sold.

I've heard some complaints on the Avalon seats, but you really need to do the sitting yourself. One car can be completely comfortable to one person and bad for another. The Avalon I drove was very comfy.I've had several Impala rentals and they are great cruisers and meet all the requirements you listed. Bench seats not the greatest IMHO. We drove an Impala LS for quite awhile and the leather buckets with heat were much better. I'd spring for the 3.8L over the 3.4L. The 3.8L isn't as smooth as the Toyota/Nissan V6's, but it's pretty good. Power is good and very quiet cruising. If you're offended by some silly plastic assembly & visible screws here and there then maybe you won't like the Impala. But I would definetely at least consider it. Very comfy for long trips, excellent reliability from what I've seen, 30mpg should be easy, traction control is available, and the price is very appealing. The Max is a good car, but smaller than the Avalon. Not going to be as comfortable (ride, room, etc.) but still a good car. VW is a beautiful car, but not practical to plan on 200K trouble free miles. I'm not saying it can't be done, but they just seem to be more ""needy"". Your talking about driving 50K per year minimum. You also need to consider maintenance costs. Avalon requires timing belt changes, spark plugs @ 60K, and other items Impala won't need as often. I used to drive that much and ran 200K up on two Camry V6's. Looking back the extra maintenance costs were worth it because I had very little in repair costs and was never stuck without a vehicle. However, I think the Impala is very capable and a much better choice over what I was picking from in the early to mid-90's. My 3rd and newest Camry V6 was a bit of a flop and an employee has been driving it since around 50K. Still no major problems at over 100K, but just not screwed together like the others were. If I was going back to the days of running 60K per year I'd be looking closely at the Impala just from a practical standpoint. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Hi,This is probably a rather strange choice I've come down to in my car shopping but would appreciate any thoughts. I want to purchase a new vehicle for under $20K and have narrowed it down to two choices: the Subaru Forester and the Hyundai Sonata. I can get a base-level Forester 5-Speed for $19,200 and a top of the line Sonata for $18,900 (with antilock brakes). My requirements are as follows and for the most part are rank-ordered: 1. Want something fun to drive. Our other vehicle is a minivan and it just doesn't excite me so I would like to get something that I can look forward to driving 2. Want something that I can reasonably expect to put 150,000 miles on. I plan to pass this on to my son when I finish paying for it in 5 years 3. Need to be able to reasonably transport the family of 5 though that is primarily what the van is for. 4. We get 2-3 snowstorms here in Northern VA per year and I would like to feel comfortable driving in it though this is not a big deal 5. Everything else: Warranty, good gas mileage, reasonable insurance, etcI am leaning towards the Sonata at this point but my one concern is that I have been driving a CR-V for the past 3 years and have heard it is hard to transition back to a sedan after driving a sports utility. On the other hand, I think SUVs are overrated.Would appreciate comments.Thankful that I have a choiceDave ",Posts: 37,Member

The Forester is better built, more fun to drive and doesn't need a warranty.

Sorry to do this but how about the new Altima? As far as your requirments go, an S-model 4cyl should ring in your price range. Has pretty decent options and you can pick if you want a manual or automatic. I've not driven the Sonata or the Forester but I'd have a hard time believing either one would put more of a smile on your face. I think the odds are just as good for the Altima hitting 150K as the others. It's a bit bigger than the others. FWD should do fine in the snow. Warranty isn't as good as Hyundai obviously. Gas mileage is proably better in real life driving. No idea on the insurance, I've never noticed much of a difference between cars once I hit a certain age. All within a few dollars a month. I know you weren't considering it, but it was recently released and thought maybe you hadn't checked it out. Your #1 priority was fun factor and it far exceeds the other in my book. Of course your idea of a fun driver could be totally different than mine as I guess we are talking family sedans. My biggest hitch with the Hyundai is resale value. I know you plan to keep it, but if you had to sell it you'd take a severe beating. And in 6-7 years you might not be able to give it away. I was at a dealer auction a few weeks ago and Hyundai's/Kia's were sooooo cheap it was kinda funny. '01 cars selling for 30%-40% of their new price. If you're really stuck on one, you could save $5,000-$6000 easily used. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

those are 2 very strange choices you have there: Sonata vs Forrester. Esp. after looking at your requirements. I don't think either vehicle can comfortably seat 5 people. The Forester rear seat is tight as well as the Sonata. And I wouldn't describe either vehicle as fun to drive. neither has a powerful engine. But with a family of five, how much fun can you have in a car. If you live in Northern VA and it snows, I'm guessign everything is shut down so driving in the snow is more an issue of having good tires on your vehicle then having AWD.As far as warranty, reliablity, etc., It will probably even out. The Subaru is more reliable but the Sonata has the better warranty. Plus you get more for your money with the Sonata. One option I would seriously look at is a leftover 2001 Accord. Good reliablity, spacious backseat, fun to drive...no but it will last you a long time and it has the best reliability and highest re-sale value in the midsize class.If you are sold on the Sonata and Forester, I would go with the Sonata. More bang for the buck. I can't make any claim it will last 150,000 miles but you do have anice warranty. ","Posts: 2,918",Member

I too, was puzzled with your choices...mostly because you don't need a snowmobile and need to occasionally carry 5 people. With the criteria you mentioned, a couple of other cars come to mind. 1. Yesterday I picked up a 2002 alero sedan. It is a fun ride, especially with my 5 speed manual. This has the same bumper/bumper warranty as the Hyundai, and is well under your price target. I paid 14,700(actually 11,500 after GM card points) straight sale.Since I too have a van, it is not my my primary vehicle, but can reasonably carry 5 as long as the rear seat is for kids. While the Ecotech 2.2 is considered reliable, I have no idea about the 150,000 benchmark. I prefer 6 or 8 cylinders for that kind of durability.2. A base Subaru legacy. It can be had for your price range, yet still has AWD. It has more room than the forester and can take a beating. I drove one of these for work and loved it. You can also get it with a stick...for added fun. 150,000 miles should not be a problem.3. You may be surprised that some v-6 cars get as good or better mileage than these cars. Some options are Malibu or base Impala...both lots of room and engines that will last. Neither of these are sports sedans though.I'm not sure how many leftover 01 cars are available, but the Accord fits the reliability catagory. ",Posts: 235,Member

Thanks for all the great inputs and advice on my rather strange choice of cars. For what it is worth (perhaps not very much), perhaps I can explain how I arrived at these two choices: - The Mrs likes SUVs and her input does make a difference--the only one I could find that I felt comfortable with the price and reliability was the Subaru. The CRVs ( a bit too expensive), XL-7 (expense) and Sportage (reliability and size) were others that I considered but ruled out. The Forester seems quite nice but a bit small. I just don't like the whole aura that surrounds the SUV and its drivers - As for sedans, if I were to buy one, I want one that is fun to drive. I have had a few Accords and as much as I liked them, they strike me as really dull (no offense to Accord owners). I like the looks of the new Altima quite a bit but they are selling at a premium right now. I have not looked at the Alero but plan to so thanks for the input on it. The reason I've focused on the Sonata is that they seem to be drawing raves from everywhere I've checked--the fact that I can get a V-6 leather sedan for under $19K is amazing to me. I hadn't heard very much in the negative column though the comment about 2001 used Sonatas selling at 40% of MSRP scares me I must admit.Is the Sonata a case of you get what you pay for or is the timing right to buy one considering that it is starting to be mentioned in the same breath as the Honda (without snickering)?I'm still torn but am in no rush--thanks for everyone's thoughts for this schizophrenic prospective buyerDave ",Posts: 37,Member

The RWD does not have the winter traction of FWD...which seems to be a problem for women drivers, and I personally never buy used cars.A nice car for your range might be a Grand Prix SE. Definitely sporty, Very solid, and lots of room. The SE does not have all the body cladding of the other models. I have a feeling your wife might like the looks too. I'm not a pontiac guy, but it really impressed me. I'm not a fan of orange dash lights and probably never will be, but they do stand out.

Dave,When it comes to cars, I think most women have a bit in common. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife who trusts my judgement more than her own impulsive nature.Don't get me wrong, I didn't mean to steer you to an american car. Like I said, the legacy is a great car. For your price range, the domestics offer alot of car for the money.I look at all cars, and am pretty stingy so I judge by personal experience...not popular perception. I realize that people's first impressions of a car are based on looks and price. One thing I have against the korean cars are overall quality and repair costs. I'll never get over the cost of brakes and other routine maintenance parts (fuel filter, etc.) for 2 Korean cars I worked on. THey were at least 2 to 4 times more expensive than domestic parts. I always heard japanese cars were that way, but I never had one to work on.Another thing I have against hyundai's is the poor fuel economy in relation to their engine performance. For example, the 3.1 in the grand prix gets better economy than a 2.7 sonata, despite being a heavier car. An impala 3.4 gets even better mileage. Happy hunting! ",Posts: 235,Member

The big problem with both of these cars is (going back to your original post) neither car can seat 5 comfortably and neither is fun to drive esp. in an automatic.The Alero is nice but again the seating for 5 is tight (very tight). Take a serious look at the Chevy Impala Base esp. with the $2002 back. Also you may want to consider a used Accord (99-00). You may even be able to get a V6 for $18-$19k. This is a tough one. I understand your commitment to staying under $20k. Went through the same process in JUly with the same financial restraints. I ended up buying a Chevy Malibu LS. I'vm very happy with that purchase but it may not fit your longterm reliability. Bought it for $17.1 with $1500 back from Chevy. Also look at the Saturn L200. I believe that goes for less then $20k. Compare those to the Sonata. I imagine they all will come out about the same. One may ride better then teh others. Or one may handle better then another. In this price class most cars are similar except they may have different characters. The reliability is hit or miss outside of the Toyota and Honda fields.Good luck with your searching.

Meanwhile, people who post on the Subaru boards are so friendly and helpful you wonder if you have to pass a personality test before they agree to sell you a Subaru.

read Hyundai SF is ok on some gravel and minor dirt backroads,trails(without boulders or whatever,in the pathways)..good for foul weather, and can save about $5Grand vs forrester,or more(?)I do not drive suv, and have not driven a santa fe...it looked good in showroom, and the above comments were in car and driver,etc, 2002 models reviews.I do not care for Accents,either, but is sounds like you either need a family car or xuv/suv thing. Just keep on test driving, or do as i did a few yrs ago(before digital odometers) I owuld see a Hyundai, look at odometer in the parking lot and see alot of 70,000-113,000 mile vehicles witout rust, or torn up interiors,etc....I figured after looking at 20 or so of these higher mileage cars, running daily, looking good after 3-8 years, and dierent models, they couldn;t be as bad as they said...or they wouldn't make it to 70,000-113,000+ miles without rust, or looking almost like new interiors,and i even checked tail pipe....see if there was excessive soot....!! No joke. I even looked on the under carriage of 5 of them, the older ones, or holes, rust, damage....onbe problem, if you live reall far from a dealership, or only one in 100 miles...that could be a big deterrent, or anything you decide on. I know we have 2 subaru dealership in a 120 mile radius, and about1 0 Hyudnai dealerships(abou 100 GM/Ford,of course).The 3Hyudnai dealerships near us are 37-55 miles away..the rest are 80-120 miles.

same as LX nowaday. Like one guy said, it is up to your personal preferences.Our sonata has 70,319 miles as of today, in 30 months....CD player was damaged in a 55 mph wreck, it will be fixed. The check engine light came on at 58,500...it was the timing belt getting ready to go(60,000 miles is recommended change out time) they replaced it FREE, under warranty.the dealership was kind of lying, though, I didn't knwo(now i do) that they are supposed to give you a FREE rental or warranty items, yet they charged me $32. Needless to say, we got our Tiburon somewhere else after that,and go to one tha will give you a car for major tune ups,free, or warranty items.Be sure to ask dealerships about this issue, it 'd be nice . the 60,000 mile tune up took about 6 hours, you could drop off car before work, drive a free rental to work, o wherever, and returnb when work is done.

Well, thanks again for all the great comments. I had the itch to buy and decided to make a purchase tonight. I went with Hyundai but decided against the Sonata--going with the Elantra hatchback instead. I feel very good about the car--I think it meets most of my requirements. It is definitely fun to drive (IMHO) and I feel good about the potential of it lasting 150K miles (don't laugh at me). It will fit 4 comfortably but 5 will be cramped but we have a van so that is no big deal. Gas mileage is not quite as high as you would expect (24/31 I believe) but a bit better than the CR-V I am turning in. Insurance will rise $60 per 6 months but that is okay by me.I went with the Elantra because it was $4K cheaper than the Sonata I wanted and I did not think the difference to me was worth that much money. The Elantra actually has better headroom than the Sonata. I got a deal that was about $700 below the Edmunds TMV so I feel great about that as well. Would have liked to have seen the new Forester but I just can't see spending $22K. Am anxious to see it though. Will let you know my impression on the Elantra as time passes.Thanks againDave ",Posts: 37,Member

First, the Sonata GLS V6 and the LX are not the same. The LX has leather seats, power seats, and an automatic climate control system. If you've ever had or been in a car with automatic climate control, you know it does not compare with manual! No real biggie as the major mechanicals are the same, but they are not the same car.

i was speaking of the 1999 GLS-V6 we own, it has leather, 8 wya power seats,yadda,yadda. I meant ot say that the 2002 LX is= to the OLD 1999 GLS... they had SOnata and the trumped up GLS , leather coulkd be added or not, to the V6 package, not for the 4 cylinder(Base model, in 1999).Today, in 2002, GLS is cloth, from what I have seen....so in order to get leather(?), you NEED LX?? I did see a special order Elantra GLS, it had tan leather seats,etc, for aroun $16grand(msrp)...not bad.The GT was ok, i like dit, but the bottom seat cushion on the car we test drove felt hard compared to the GLS Elantra leather, or even Tiburon's leather for some reason? Maybe a bad seat cushion(really, both front seats felt hard, bottom cushion, the seat backs were fine).Gt is a nice car, except for the seat cushion(s) in the one car...maybe I'll see at the autoshow in March if it was just that on car with bum-seats?

Oh, okay--I get you now! You are right, though about 2002 models. The LX has standard leather and the GLS as cloth. Though, like the Elantra you saw, if you are willing to pay for it, I'm sure they would love to have leather installed in a GLS! ",Posts: 534,Member

Actually there are many great cars under 20K. I just went shopping for a mid-size sedan with the same price limitations, and came home with a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant ES (4 cylinder) for $17,500. For the same money the Sonata V6 was extremely tempting, and I could even have bought an Accord LX ad stayed under my budget (about $19,000 for an LX 4 cylinder).The Galant I bought is pretty much loaded,the only things lacking are ABS, side air bags, alloy wheels, leather and a sunroof, all of which things that I could have had on the LS model (still in my $20K budget), but didn't want to pay for. I also passed on the V6 for the same reason, I really see no use for it. The 4-cylinder has plenty of power, is so smooth and quiet I have to check the tach to make sure its even running, and has plenty of torque. The automatica transmission (standard equipment) is also a great match for the engine, with ratios well-matced to the engine's torque and power bands. This car is so competent in going about its business that it is much like a 4-cylinder Accord or Camry - so good at getting you quietly and comfortably from place to place that one tends to not even think about it.In domestics the Buick Century and Ford Taurus are also available in that range, and I would easily recommend either over the Chevy Impala, which has styling that makes me think (unpleasantly) of the old AMC Matador. The Buick has a very good quality reputation, and with GM rebates makes an attractive buy. I almost went for it, but the lack of a CD player in the base model pushed me away (I hate paying for higher trim levels).Congrats on the Elantra GT, that is a great car that is really a terrific buy, though it is in a smaller size (and correspondingly lower price) class.

I wish I had your flexibility in choosing a company car...I get more money, but have to choose from chrysler. For a company car that will see highway driving, I'd go with the Chevy Impala. It is extremely comfortable and has alot more room than your choices listed, and even has better mileage. The current edition is still kinda new, but even the automotive press is waking up to it. You could even get an LS if you bargain well.Of your choices listed, I'd take the Altima or the Saturn. The Jetta is a bit small. What kind of work do yo do? Lots of highway travel?

You can get a nice altima for that price range. Great car if you like sporty driving. The Impala is also a great travel car, but it has to meet your taste. You'll either love the comfort/room or hate it. I could live with a Jetta but it is a bit tight. If you never have riders it would be my second pick. Of course not having to worry about repair or maintenance, the Jetta 1.8t might nudge out the Altima. Tough choice. You would have alot more to choose from if they gave you another couple grand.

Most company cars I've ever seen were of the standard, 4 door, American variety.

The reason most company cars are standard, 4-door variety is because the companies are buying batches of them and essentially have to fit a large variety of needs (not wants). That was part of my duty when I worked for a major corp. At the time we were buying well equipped Luminas for $12,000 with an extended factory warranty. Those held up well for about 100K and then they'd be sold for about $2500 and replaced. I don't think many with a choice would spring for these types of vehicles and they are a far cry from fun to drive. Nobody was ever excited about getting a new lumina or taurus! Guys would always call and say hey can't I get a ""X-model"" that costs the same? No. We bought about 300 per year so every penny counted. My last couple years we were letting the salespersons order options if they paid 75% of the cost. ""No you can't have the car you want, but how about a cd player?"" Folks working for smaller companies have it easy because they usually have some say. When I first started out I made a point to be flexible. I let them give me a few suggestions and then we narrow it down. They really appreciate and take care of a vehicle they want as opposed to a POS they got stuck with. BTW, nobodys picked a taurus or lumina yet, although I'll be the first to admit they are MUCH nicer vehicles than they were in the early 90's. Well the lumina never really improved, but the Impala is a revolution. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Absolutely not true that the Maxima is fussy. It is one of the most reliable and easiest to maintain cars being built. If you like it, get it. Accord is an impeccable choice, as always. I'm less familiar with GTI. Both Accord and Maxima are at the end of their design cycle, with major revisions (really major with Maxima) due next year. That fact, plus heady competition from the new Altima, has put pressure on Maxima sales. I think there is a manufacturer's discount of $1,000 on the Maxima now, and it would be a grea time to get one if you don't mind the styling being out of date in a year. ",Posts: 476,Member

In my opinion, the Maxima SE is perhaps the best handling front wheel drive car on the market - certainly way up on the list.

I think what steeler0023 was referring to regarding the Maxima wasn't the reliability but rather the cost of doing the maintenance.

The VW Golf is also a nice car but smaller then either the maxima or Accord.If you are in that price range, you may want to take a look at the Acura as well.

Considering fuel economy, safety, comfort in freeway driving,and cost factor (approximately $18,000.00 budget for a new 2002 models), which of the VW sedans would you recommend - Jetta GLS, Jetta GLX, or Jetta 1.8T ?What does ""4cyl 4A"" or ""4cyl 5M"" mean? ""6cyl 4A"" or ""6cyl 5M"" mean ???? Which one would I choose? Thank you. ",Posts: 5,Member

I'll try to help. ""4cyl 4A"" means four cylinder engine, four-speed automatic shift. ""4cyl 5M"" is the same engine wedded to a four-speed manual transmission. ""6cyl 4A"" is the six cylinder engine with four-speed auto transmission. The 1.8T you refer to is a wonderful engine that uses a turbocharger to get a lot of pep out of a four-cylinder engine. The 6 cylinder engine is heavier, more expensive and somewhat more gas thirsty. For the Jetta, a relatively small car, I'd go with the 1.8. It has enough power to push the bigger Passat fast enough for most people.The GLX GLS business refers to different models that have different costs, features and levels of luxury. The GLX is the more deluxe.You should start by deciding if you want a stick shift or auto. Then decide if you can be happy with the 1.8 Turbo. Then go to the Edmunds site for new cars/go to Volkswagen/go to Jetta and spend some time looking at various combinations of features. The Edmunds TMV price is the price you ""should"" be able to get if you bargain well.Hope this helps. ",Posts: 476,Member

As GM removes much of what made Saturn unique, and gives it rebadged vehicles instead in the next few years, most of what will remain of the original company spirit will be (my opinion only) the friendly stuff as that is where all their marketing energy is focused. The 30-day money back guarantee, the no-haggle pricing (which is now being copied by some others), the friendly buying, delivery and service experience, etc.; the sort of stuff that puts it above all other brands in the customer satisfaction surveys, including luxury brands that _should_ be falling all over you after you drop that much cash on them.Saturn has already said that some vehicles will lack polymer panels in future, which is obvious as that is a very expensive part of the engineering, compared to deciding which re-badge gets standard cup-holders.

Last choice is the 95 g20 with all the options and about 95k miles clean title. I am going to be using this car to go from sanfranciso and vegas and mexico from la. What are the pros and cons to each car for what I need it for.Thanks for any input. ",Posts: 11,Member

I'd probably go for the Altima, though I'm sure you'd enjoy the Millenia a bit more. If you really want the Millenia I would take it to a different body shop and have them take a look at it to make sure the body repairs are okay. ",Posts: 96,Member

...or at least reserve the right to ixnay the deal if you don't like it. Cable clutches vs. hydraulic clutches, short or long throw shifters, light or heavy use of bushings in the shifter, short or tall gear spacing, etc. all affect things quite a bit and thus you may or may not like it. The last car I bought I went in thinking stick, but test-drove both and bought the automatic instead. For most people who really want a stick, it is a very personal choice so make sure. Go to another dealer who has a manual in stock if you can.That said, the usual short test drive isn't long enough to find out if you like most manual trannies. Try to take a decent long test drive to really get used to the clutch and gears to make sure you like it. Even autos, especially today's auto-adjusting electronic models, take some getting used to. Some buyers go so far as to rent a similar car for a weekend but with new cars like the 2003 Matrix and Corolla you can't do that. ",Posts: 591,Member

I answered your question in your original thread in Smart Shopper. Of these three, get the Corolla. Unless you are in your younger 20's, then the Matrix may do for you. IMO, the Matrix is a gimmick. The compact wagon was popular a couple of decades ago, then went away. Apparently it is making a comeback, but will go away again. The compact sedan has been around forever and will never go away. In other words, Matrix=parachute pants (if you are old enough to remember this huge fad--and if you are, then you are out of the Matrix target market). Corolla=tan chinos. Been around forever and not going anywhere. The Sentra seems to have had some problems lately. This current design has had about 3 recalls including a major engine failure recall most recently. However, the Nissan dealer will probably bend over backward to sell you a Sentra. The Toyota dealer will make you bend over because they are not about to ""wheel and deal"" on either of these hot new cars. Good luck in your decision. ",Posts: 534,Member

for my tastes, I would lean towards the Corolla out of the 3. the Matrix/Vibe really intrigue me as well as the rest of the new sports wagon designs. The styling is a bit much for me but really like the concept. Lots of interior space without the penalty of a SUV or minivan. If the styling were a bit mor tame, I would pick the Matrix over the other 3. NOt gimmicky at all, just a sign of things to come. ","Posts: 2,918",Member

I've been looking for an entry level luxury sedan. I'm tired of shifting in heavy traffic so I really appreciate the auto-manual features. Here is what I've tested in the past year:Acura TL & TLS - The TLS was semi-fun to drive. Has a lot of features for the price. I found the rear seat room better than the Edmunds review. Some interior looked cheap - especially in beige w/wood. The black and gray looked much better. It keeps getting to the top of my list, but the styling is sooo boring that it keeps falling back off.BMW 330i - Great car, few cars drive like a BMW. Rear seat to small. After all the options pushes over $40k and drops way out of the price range.Infiniti I30 - A nice luxury car for a dull person who doesn't care about sportyness at all.Infiniti G35 - Can't wait to try this one!Lexus IS300 - I thought this car handled better than the BMW. I like the styling inside and out except for the back seat and trunk are too small, the rear end looks like it was chopped off, and I hate clear lenses.Nissan Altima SE 3.5 - I didn't drive it, but the interior plastic looked so bad and the cloth was fuzzy. I looked like a skinned Chihuahua.Nissan Maxima - Interior was the same as the Altima. Go head for the nearest Infiniti dealer.Volvo S60 T5 - What an amazing disappointment. I think the turbo was broken. The car was so slow and felt so spongy I couldn't wait to get back to the dealer. The rear seat was the smallest of the bunch.These are just my opinions. I hope they help someone. ",Posts: 7,Member

spud's mood may have been ruined by the Altima and he may not have liked the Maxima no matter what. I agree--he should go back and give the Maxima a clean slate. Also, he keeps going back to the TL, but goes way again because he does not like the styling. That seems to be the knock on all Honda products. The TL may not be the most exiting looking car in your group, but you know it will run forever and treat you right. Maybe you should just go with it--since you keep coming back to the TL anyway.

I was reading a few posts back wrt the Forester/Sonata decision and was thinking - wow - there really are people just like me out there...!  j/kANYWAYS...I have some very similar needs, but my choices are quite different.We're down to 2 vehicles. One contributing factor is that I get the GM employee discount, so I will buy a new GM, in all probability.So - the choices: A Pontiac Grand Prix GT, and a Jimmy/Blazer.The factors: -We live in a northern part of the world, lots of snow, and the inlaws live on a beef farm. Gotta negotiate some rough terrain getting up their drive after a good dump of the white stuff, but I believe the GP's traction control + snow tires would suffice.-Both of us love driving, and have always like the GP - in fact its one of the only cars we both do like...!-But, of course, the wife wants to drive a ""cool"" SUV, which sits high on the road. What's up with that? She would possibly relunctantly settle for the GP, but I'd prefer a more symbiotic decision, so would appreciate any input.-other criteria:  -Size, we're both tall and presently cram ourselves into an old Saturn SC.  -Power: want enough oomph to keep up with our highway driving .  -Cargo - planning a family, don't want to limit the room for baby, kid paraphanelia, etc..I really believe the GP suits our needs, but must admit I do not want to find us limited in a year or 2. But I just don't want to buy a lot more than I need, which the Jimmy/Blazer would be, IMO.Points? Opinions? Tips?Thanks! ",Posts: 15,Member

I would get the Grand Prix. If you are planning a family in the near future, get the sedan. A family of three will fit in a GP sedan without any problems. I believe you will be safer in the GP anyway. I don't know about the new Trailblazer, but the previous Chevy Blazer was rated the most dangerous SUV on the road. Every time I read about an overturned vehicle and people are killed, it's an SUV. Whenever I see a vehicle overturned in a ditch, it's an SUV. People have this false sense of security because they think they are safe in an SUV. The fact is that with their high center of gravity and the false sense of security by the driver, they flip very easily. I just read about the guy with the Padres who was killed when his SUV flipped. The Mets had a player die last year when his SUV flipped. A man where I live had his children killed when he ran a red light in his Suburban and he got hit by a bus. I guess he thought he was invincible in the Suburban--know he knows differently. We don't get much snow here in Georgia, but when we do, there are always pictures of things like Grand Cherokees laying sideways in a ditch because the driver falsely thought his truck was built for that environment. For your question, I would get the sedan. ",Posts: 534,Member

I don't really understand why people come here and ask for comparisons between totally different vehicles. I mean, what do you want us to say? The GP handles better than an blazer. The GP is quicker than a blazer. I'm not trying to bust your chops, but you really have to make a decision as to which way you want to go, and then compare. But here's some opinions, at no charge!The blazer/jimmy are horrible vehicles. Rattle traps, doors fall off, tranny good for maybe 130K if lucky. The new Trailblazer seems to be a better built vehicle and a better option in your case. It drives alot like a car, pretty low center-of-gravity, good power, lots of room. Not going to get you anywhere off-road, but certainly won't have trouble with snow-covered roads.The GP is a pretty nice car. I think some of the ""plastic"" packages are bit much, and the interior has enough buttons to control a 747, but alot of people must like that. If your Saturn can make it up your in-laws driveway, then I'm sure the GP can. If the saturn doesn't make it, I doubt the GP would. Traction control doesn't get you that far. My in-laws have a killer driveway, and the last time they were SUV shopping, a couple of them couldn't make it up during the test-drive. It takes a real 4X4 with real tires to make it up their drive when it's snowy and you don't want to walk 300 yards with the groceries.And I agree, if you really have no need for 4X4 or an SUV, please don't buy one. You're really making life miserable for the folks like me that actually need a vehicle that can cross muddy fields, tow trailers, and get out snowy roads that haven't been plowed/salted. The SUV's/trucks are turning into wimped out minivans with 4-doors and suspensions that can barely get over a curb. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I just hope you bought a FWD model since you didn't need it. That at least sends a message that people want SUV looking vehicles but not 4X4. What's screwy about the whole situation is that the small SUV's that actually have some utility keep getting cancelled. Why? Because everyone wants a minivan that looks like an SUV and makes them feel safe from all the other SUV's. So what does the person that needs utility do? They have to buy a bigger vehicle! In a few years, if you want a real 4X4 system and the ability to tow anything you'll have to buy a heavy duty truck. I have one I use for towing horses, and it weighs over 7000# empty. Wouldn't you just love for everyone that currently can get what they need out of a Cherokee, Blazer, or 4runner, to buy Tahoe's, Expeditions, Excursions, or 1-ton trucks? The RX300 won't make it up my in-laws driveway when its snowy, and the last test Car and Driver did on small SUV's, the only ones that could make it through their snow course was the Cherokee and Xterra. That was two out of 11 vehicles that could perform as designed. I drive my wifes car alot, and we're looking at getting an A6 for traveling. I'm not going to sit around popping Paxil all day worrying about an SUV plowing into me. There's always vehicles bigger than you regardless of what you're driving. If I'm not in a situation that requires a utility vehice, I'd much rather get down the road at warp speed in an A6 rather than a Jeep or 7000# pickup. A couple seconds at an intersection isn't that big of deal when you can drive a superior performing vehicle 99% of the time. I'm not sure how I could ever get along without a truck or SUV with my lifestyle, but if I lived in town and had no need for 4X4, I'd be in a sports car of some sort. It's not like you can't get a helluva car for what I spent on a diesel pickup. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I just hope you bought a FWD model since you didn't need it.I wanted a V6, and it is extremely hard to find a V6 without AWD. Also, I am very impressed with my A4's AWD. How good is Toyota's system compared to my Audi's, remains to be seen of course.There's always vehicles bigger than you regardless of what you're drivingTrue. But, if I am in a small car(like my A4), chances are that in a relatively affluent suburban neighborhood, 4 out of 6 cars will have a much larger mass than my car. On the other hand, if I am in a SUV, that number will probably drop to about every 1 in 6 vehicles.A couple seconds at an intersection isn't that big of deal ...That was just an example. And, it is far more than a couple of seconds because as soon as a SUV makes a turn, another moves in to fill its place. The real problem here is that it is very hard to see in general when you are driving in a sea of SUVs around you. That is a real safety hazard in my opinion. ",Posts: 438,Member

Thanks for your help, sebring ... I think. FWIW, I have been comparing sedans and SUVs for 2 years now. My wife and I differ in opinion as to what suits our needs. I thought a site that seems to have a wide range of experience and opinion might be a place to turn for help. So, for those who find it neccessary to question my motivation: I am looking for a perspective from sedan owners as to whether their needs that were similar to mine are being met by sedans or if they feel wanting for a higher capacity vehicle. Also, if they experience conditions warranting 4wd and ground clearance similar to mine, and might find a need for an SUV or the like.Anyone who has a constructive opinion would be appreciated.

Here's my take-I just went through it last spring before I bought a Passat and a Catera.I had a GM credit card discount I couldn't walk away from. I can't get exicted about either vehicle you mentioned,but how about this...Similar,but far better than the Grand Prix is the Olds Intrigue. With all the discounts,you could probably get one for a song. I think it is the best US vehicle GM makes. I have zero interest in SUVs,and it sounds like one would be a poor choice for you. I agree the Blazer is a particularly poor one,though. The Trailblazer seems better...Also,the Tahoe would probably be satisfying. How about a Buick Park Avenue? I bet your Buick dealer is dying to sell one of these.If you want something more youthful,how about a Cadillac CTS? I love my Catera. ",Posts: 565,Member

I agree. Before settling onthe Grand Prix. Try an Olds Intrigue. Classier car then the GP and about the same price but with much deeper discounts. And I would get either car over the Trailbalzer. Not that I don't think highly of the Trailblazer (I don't) but if youaren't towing anything or traveling off -road, a SUV is not the best way to go. Poor gas mileage, more items to go wrong (4x4 system), handling, etc. are just some of the reasonss I owuld go with the sedan.Good luck. ","Posts: 2,918",Member

You want a Highlander to see over the other SUVs in an intersection? You want a Highlander so you can survive a crash? You need an SUV because of the SUVs in your affluent neighborhod?

Well, it beats walking, but not by much. You did not say whether it was new or not, so I assume it is a 2002 you are considering.I have three friends who all bought new hyundais n the last few years. 2 traded theirs already(Excel and Accent)\, the third (elantra) will very soon. None of the three will buy Hyundai again. Part of that is due to their income (they bought the hyundais just out of college)but they all were dissatisfied.As far as the Accents went, nothing major ever went wrong, other than an electrical problem that left one friend stranded for awhile. Most of the problems were of the annoying variety...turn signal switch failure, service lights, oil consumption.For all of them, they bought due to the low price, but it really didn't pay off due to how quickly they traded up, and the low resale value. Personally, resale value is not a big deal to me since I like to keep my cars for awhile. But I can't imagine wanting to drive a Hyundai for a long time.It may be best to spend a bit more for something nicer and with more resale. Maybe a focus, sentra, civic.

I never would have thought of an Alero being in the same price range as the Civic, but the GX with 5 Speed/sport package has an invoice price of about 16,000, minus the current $2002 rebate.

The engine has a nice flat torque curve, and it works well when you have a full car. Check out the Mazda Protege forum here at edmunds. The Protege owners here in Edmunds are freaks about their cars.

I like the Mazda, but the only reason I see to buy a small car is gas mileage and it's just not that great compared to civic or corolla.

JRL: First of all I'm buying this for an employee who is driving about 250 miles per day. So mpg is a big concern, although I'm not going to stick someone in a metro or super-sub compact. The Corolla and Civic were pretty much no-brainers, but we did look at the Mazda too. However, 31mpg on the highway is rediculous. I've had larger V6 vehicles turn that kind of highway mpg. So the Mazda never made the test-drive list, another reason being the scarcity of dealers around here. The Civic and Corolla are very similar cars, the Corolla feels roomier to me, and is much better looking IMHO. In addition it feels a bit more solid. Power/handling/ride are within the same ballpark, but I think the Corolla was a bit quieter on the highway. My experience between Honda and Toyota leaves Toyota ahead on durability and they do it with less maintenance, (typically).The only reason I haven't bought yet is because we were also trying to buy a Celica and can't find one with the options we want. I'm using both sales as an incentive for them to find the Celica we want. The way Toyota builds and options their cars just gets me soooooo mad. I like their vehicles, but they are just so hard to buy sometimes. If they aren't going to make the options available everywhere, they should just not even offer it. Usually it takes a few weeks to get what I want, but this Celica thing has been the worst. frustratedmom: The Grand Marquis and Lumina are both pretty reliable vehicles. The Lumina probably a bit more IMHO. They are pretty bland, boring, and rattle-traps though. You can't do much worse than the old Pontiac Transports, so you have no where to go but up! The Chevy Impala is a by far a better vehicle than either choice though. Larger than the Lumina and built much better. Should be able to find one for $12,000 with low miles, or within your price range with 50K or so miles. The Grand Marquis is also rear-wheel drive, which may or may not matter to you. The Century isn't near as big. Go look at in Impala and let us know what you think, it's like night and day compared to the Lumina. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

The Grand Marquis(or Crown vic) should be a decent choice. Also consider a larger FWD GM sedan like a Buick LeSabre, Olds Eighty-Eight,or Pontiac Bonneville from say 93 on.

My lady friend mentioned she is ready to trade up from her Escort ZX2 and the first car she mentioned was a Civic(typical female response). Needless to say I'm trying to broaden her horizons car wise. Nothing wrong with the Civic except they are EVERYWHERE and have the personality of a Maytag Washer. She is on a limited budget so my type of cars are out, but I did get her 4 different cars to look at. Ford Focus, Oldsmobile Alero, Nissan Altima, and Mazda Protege. The Nissan and Olds would have to be base models as they are a bit pricier. Olds is discounting big time, but I'm not sure about Nissan since the Altima is brand new.

The later Lumina's ('97 on) are quite solid IMO. '98 is probably better but my '97 is solid and apparently safer than many other sedans, particularly the light weight imports and even many of the larger ones. Parts are generally cheaper and widely available. After 5+ yrs. the only things I've replaced is oil, filter, coolant, battery and radiator hoses (latter two items for preventive maintenance). If you get a base sedan it was probably a rental or other fleet car so the low mileage doesn't necessarily indicate TLC. In my area Enterprise Rental Cars offers many 01 Luminas. ",Posts: 618,Member

In regard to the Mercury Grand Marquis... I would steer clear of the early 90's models. The engine (4.6 L - Overhead cam) was a brand new design in 91 for the Towncar and 92 for the G.M. My dad retired a 1984 Grand Marquis a couple years ago that had 221,000 miles with hardly any repairs, ever! The engine (5.0 L) still wanted to go, but the body rusted out.

Just drove them all 3 this weekend. Here is my take for what its worth. All were 4cyl Camry - Nice car. Liked the lines. Hated the steering wheel. Its built for people below 6' My arms were tired just from the test drive reaching for it. Ran good, rode good. 4cyl was not what I thought it would be.Altima - Great Looks. New styling. Steering wheel adjustable up/down and in/out Big win for bigger people. Interior is not as nice as Camry or Accord. 4cyl ran like a champ. Nice in cornering. Accord - Nice looking car. Drove great. Smooth 4 cyl. Steering wheel was better than camry but not as good as altima. Exterior is somewhat dated. Interior was nicely dressed.My choice was the Altima. ",Posts: 3,Member

For those of you looking at the Camry, Accord & Altima, I researched sedans for two months before we bought the Maxima. We wanted 4 door, good gas mileage, ABS, no sunroof, no leather, cassette tape and CD player for under 23K. We found it all in the GXE Maxima after looking at the new Altima (no cassette and cheap looking interior), Camry (short seat and my husband is 6'3"" so the seats were uncomfortable on a long test drive), Accord EX (had ABS but came with a sunroof which took away head room, and I had some safety concerns after reading about Accord brake failures on the NHTSA web site and the Accord V6 has had some tranny problems.) The Maxima has a proven V6 engine that has won awards. It comes standard with Xenon headlights which *really* improve visibility, (seems my 42 year old eyes don't see as well at night as they used to). We also like the auto dim rearview mirror. The car has twice as much HP (255) as our old 93 Accord (125). We were also pleasantly surprised to get 28-29 mpg on a long road trip so we didn't lose anything in gas mileage. We liked the softer ride of the GXE over the SE even though I was able to get quotes for the SE within a $100 of the GXE. The GXE has 16"" tires which are cheaper to replace and have a more narrow turning radius (U-turn.) I don't care if the Maxima will be ""dated"" when it is redesigned next year because I like the Maxima ""old"" design much better than the new design look of the Altima front grill. There was a $1000 rebate on the Max because the Altima is being pushed by Nissan right now. I found that the GXE was not easy to find. It comes standard with options that you have to really look for to find on an Altima... esp the ABS. This car is great, I wish we could buy two. We paid $22,333 in Atlanta, plus $489 advertising fee, plus 6% sales tax, plus tag & title. After the rebate and a $500 factory to dealer incentive the drive out price was $23,212 which was pretty close to the loaded V6 Altima. ",Posts: 22,Member

I'm with you on the Maxi over the overpriced and underpowered Accord and Camry as well as the fast but currently MSRP only Altima. Another good choice for a powerful fun to drive sedan at or near the $23K mark is the Oldsmobile Intrigue. Standard V6, ABS, 16"" alloy wheels, as well as the typical power goodies. Can be had with or without sunroof and leather. With current rebates and incentives a nicely loaded one could be had for 23K or even less. And they also include a 5 year 60K full warranty. I have a 2001 model and it is a blast to drive so I just had to get a plug in:) Mileage wise, unless your driving like me(tach at redline every chance I get) you'll get decent mileage. 28-29 mpg is what I averaged on a drive to Chicago last fall.

Does the intrigue have traction control? I was considering the Intrigue for it's roominess and 3.5 engine.I agree the intrigue is a great car. However, I'm not sure Altima/Maxima types will like it.

Of those I like the Acura. You should have higher reliability with it. Plus, to get the Quattro, you have to lease 48 months, which is bad. Speaking of bad, why not find a car you can afford and buy it instead? Nissan has good deals on the Maxima now, why not try one of those out? You could probably own a Maxima for about what you are looking to pay for these cars you want to borrow. ",Posts: 534,Member

Traction control is optional on the base Intrigue and standard on the GL and GLS models. It is a full range traction control system that will both reduce engine power and apply the brake to a wheel that is spinning. I've driven mine in the snow and was amazed at how well it did.

I'm not sure what you're goals are here, but in the entry-level luxury vehicles, I think the Audi is a nicer vehicle. Something about the cheaper MB's just scream ""desperate to own a MB"" in my book. Both are going to be expensive to fix after the warranty is up and probably both will have niggling issues. A reliable entry-level option would be the Lexus ES300 or maybe even throw the dice on the Infiniti G35 which will stomp any of the entry levels in most performance aspects.

I agree with Sebring, something about entry level MBs(and BMWs) seem cheap. Looks wise, the A4 wins hands down over the C-class anyway. As for reliability, that I don't know.

You have quite a wide range there. The 325i can be had for under 30 grand while the 330i will push 40 easily. The styling on the G35 is very polarizing. You either love it or hate it. I think it looks good, but may not age well, sort of like the new 740i IMO. I think it's hard to go wrong on the I35. For under 30 grand, you get (I think) 255 hp, leather, sunroof, BOSE, traction control, and a real back seat if you ever need to drive friends/customers anywhere. Not too mention a great warranty and superior service at the dealership. You won't go wrong with any of these, I believe, but I would go for the I35 myself.

The end of the line for the current Accord and Maximas make them very attractive right now. I see Maximas starting under 20 grand with SE models with leather and sunroof for around $23,000. For the Honda, check out the EX. They are going in the 17's around here and are MUCH better than the LX or SE. Remember the SE is an LX with a few EX-type options. The EX is a much better car--mechanically. FWIW, the 4 cylinder in the Camry and Accord is more than adequte, IMO. Sure, it's no 255 HP six like the Maxima; but, the 4 cylinder is no slouch.

right now are on the accord - they will be replacing it in the fall, and want to sell what's left. They also have a flood of those '02 VPs right now - should be able to get a really great deal on one at the moment.The Maxima is going to be harder to get a good price, because they just put the more powerful engine in it, and IMO it is not worth it, because in a year or two they will be coming out with an all new maxima, which for one thing will not have the rear beam axle (how could they still have that on this car?). If you love Nissan, DEFINITELY go with the new altima instead - all the powertrain is intact, handling is better, and manual available with V-6 engine. Plus, about the same price, just a little less of the luxury goods.Camrys are going pretty cheap right now too - lots of incentives, free maintenance, advertised prices under $18K. BUT you should be able to do even better than that price on an Accord, as long as you are not hung up on having the latest best thing.And hey!

First, maybe I typed something wrong... the I35 is not under $18k. As per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last Sunday (May 19), these are the prices I found. Troncalli Infiniti in Decatur, GA has the 2002 G20 with auto, leather, and sunroof for $17,990 and the 2002 I35 with the sunroof and sunshade package for $25,990. They say they have ""several to choose."" I know of a guy who bought a $26k I35, so I believe their prices are legit. Team Nissan in Marietta, GA has the 2002 Maxima SE with auto for $19,777 with dealer keeping rebates and add tax, tag and title. They also advertise the 2002 Sentra with auto and CD for $10,777 which is a heck of a price as well. Most Nissan dealers don't price the Maximas in their ads--they just say they are $6000 off MSRP. Another Nissan dealer advertises the Altima with leather and automatic for about $19,650. The best I've seen for Accords is at Lanier Honda in Buford, GA (near the Mall of Georgia). They advertise a new Accord LX with automatic for $15,644. They have a new SE with auto for $16,844 and an EX with V6 and leather for $20,844. Someone asked how the EX was better than the LX when they have the same 150 HP VTEC engine. I don't have my 2002 Accord brochure any more, so I don't remember all the little differences. They did include things like the LX having rear drum brakes with no ABS while the EX has 4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes. There were other things having to do with maybe rear cupholders and the standard stereo or something as well. If you go to the Honda dealer and get a brochure, you will find that there are actually many differences between the two besides the sunroof. ",Posts: 534,Member

I'm surprised that you have narrowed your choices to such disparate cars. The TL is essentially a Honda Accord. The car is a nice, substantial, somewhat dull but very reliable car.

Also I heard all the horrible story about it's reliability (Jettas are made in Mexico, I don't know that have something to do with that) If you like VW, why not consider the Passat???

I am looking at getting a new car but I cannot decide between an Audi A4 3.0 and a Volvo S60 2.4T. I think they are both great cars and the way I have priced them out they are both about the same, appx. $35K.The pros about the Audi are that the HP is better than the volvo (220 vs 197), I can get Xenon lights and there's a little more room in the back seat. The cons about it are bad cup holder and concerns over quality.The pros about the Volvo are a more distinctive look, better cup holder, great reputation for safety and some past personal history (my parents have had 3 of them). The cons are the lack of Xenon lights, the 197HP vs 220HP, the cramped back seat and the black door guard along the sides, front and rear.The Audi looks like the better car, but I really like the way the Volvo looks. Any thoughts?Thanks.Tony ",Posts: 29,Member

Get what you like--what is most important to you. Is looking good more important than fun to drive? It seems to me that you put a lot of emphasis on power, the rear seat and Xenon headlamps. All of these point you to the Audi. If you check the July 2002 issue of Road & Track, these two cars (in slightly different form) are in the group of 11 tested cars in the cover story. If it matters, you can see why they placed the S60 9th and the A4 5th. One suggestion, have you tried the Infiniti G35? Similar price tag with much more power and a biger back seat (and trunk) than the A4--whose back seat you preferred because it was the bigger of the two. Good luck! ",Posts: 534,Member

Hey guys,  I need some help. I'm 17 years old and I'm shopping for a car that I'll get in 5-6 months. My parents are buying the car for me. I'm different from my peers, I don't want some garbage Fast and Furious Car, I want Bavarian Autosport(We already have a Benz '99 Turbodiesel-torque, torque, torque!!!) Well anyways, my parents are giving me a range of $35k and under. Honestly I prefer to get used so I can get a better car. I want a lot of performance, but my parents won't let me get a stick, my mom can't drive stick(Bye bye M3...) I have a couple of options-540iA, I want that 282 hp engine, Porsche Boxster, Benz SLK, and anything else German(No Audi-not a big fan).

Since Audi is not an option, the 325i is the way to go. I guess a 325Ci may be preferable. However, a BMW is not a BMW (3er, anyway) with an automatic and no Sport Package. Anyone driving a 3er with a slushbox messed up and meant to buy an ES300 or TL instead.

Another suggestion, and take it for what it's worth, is a '99 - '00 MB CLK. You are a young guy, probably doesn't have to haul a great deal(?), one helluva budget and great taste in vehicles. IMO, its a nice looking car that isn't a BMW (which has already been suggested). ",Posts: 465,Member

Get a used 530i. I agree with porknbeans that you have both exceptional taste and an equally exceptional ""first car"" budget, but at age 17, you also lack the experience required to handle a high-performance car without wrapping it around a tree.A number of years ago I drove a base model 525i automatic (slower than the 530i), and honestly it was a wonderful car in every sense of the word. It had more than enough power, delightful handling, and something else VERY important to any young driver, it didn't attract the attention of every cop looking to write tickets.What you want in a first car is something with very predictable handling, responsive controls, and no nasty surprises. A good driving course, such as Bondurants, is also a VERY good idea. ",Posts: 314,Member

I want to buy either a 2003 540iA or a 2003 Mercedes-Benz E500. I was leaning toward the BMW until I learned the new 5 series will not be released until next year as a 2004 model. I think the BMW is the better car but am hesitant to purchase a car in that price range in its last year of production. The E500 on the otherhand is brand new (granted small exterior changes from 2002) and has a 306hp engine.

hey thanks for all your help. Today I went to the Audi dealer where the guy was dying to sell me a 2003 A6 with every single option thinking i was really dumb and my brain cells were made from testosterone. I quote him by saying, ""You know since your young, you will need a sport package with the chrome rims so everyone sees you in the school parking lot."" No i want the sport package because of the stiffer suspension and then he tries to dump every option-sunshade and 10cd changer, not 6-these dealers are quite stupid while underestimating that people do they're homework before they walk in...anyway i found out over the weekend while going to service the MB that my dad does know that the 540 has 324 lb-ft and 282 hp, so bye bye 540... Lawman-525 seemed good-hmmm-if you had your choice what would you pick between these and don't worry i'm not going to, ""fast and furiouize"" these cars RaysCar-I have(parents) 99 Turbodiesel(E300)..service, depends where you are, i would go with benz...only service though...its known that with new model years, benz has some problems(we drove the 2000 C-class as a loaner and it was kinda screwy) also remeber back in 96 when the E-classes were recalled(airbag warning)..but then again the new E looks great...the bimmer has a small rear seat...If i could spend in low 50k range, i would go with a Pre Owned Certified 740iL because of its timeless look, but if you want to keep up with the jones', go with a used S-class(to keep the german motif) and you'll look great for another 2-3 years..sorry this post was so long and thanks for your help!!!

Bavarianfreak, you're saying below $35k, so why are you looking at new A6s (loaded ~$50k). If it were my $35k, I'd definitely check out a new 325i or A4 1.8t, they both start at $27k and with a few options (get the sport package and sunroof on either, at least), you're right around $30k. Add another $1000-1500 for automatic trans and bingo. Oh yeah, the red leather BMW offers right now looks kinda hot.Also, the A6, to me, is not a 'young guy' car. I kinda think of it along with the E and the 5-series. My mom has a 300E (she's 53). A bit too big or something. ","Posts: 2,628",Member

 rayscar - Honestly, go with your heart on this one. Both are awesome cars with the performance edge to BMW and the sentimental/traditional one going to the MB (in my opinion). There may be problems with the new MB because of the model change and from what I've heard the new 5 series will resemble the new/current 7 series. Personally, I think the resale, when it is all said and done, will be a marginal difference. What it boils down to is have the dealer do a search for a current 540 (even if that is a 2002). You like it better and the wait and new styling may be too much.bavarian - ghulet gave a great suggestion on the A4. You would still be able to get the 3.0 liter with quattro for the price your looking at. Nice car, nice size for you and not real flashy for the police to track you (not that I condone such behavior). BTW, do you need a brother? How about a really good friend of the family?

very funny...btw i do have a brother and he gets the MB.

I found out at that dealer and other dealers that the standard price fore a 2-3 year old A6 is a little under 30k plus the guy straight up told me that they get a 10% profit so my dad could knock down at least 2k from making 2 or more dealers fight. Also I need some more room because I'm a big guy...so I don't mind somewhat of a ""Soccer-Mom"" car.. rwmiller-don't mind me asking, but what is your price range, because the first thing you're looking for is an accomidating front seat and reliability(its for your wife)-perhaps you could go for an Accord I need you guys to check out this site called swapalease.com-people swap their leases and i thought it was cool...thanks a lot!!!

It is kind of painful for me to suggest this, and it certainly flies in the face of the vehicles that you have been trying, but have you considered an ""American"" luxury car? For example, the Ford Crown Vic, Mercury Grand Marquis (or Marauder), Lincoln or Cadillac? The reason that I suggest them is because they have a larger and easier entry/exit than most foreign vehicles. It may not be your cup of tea and your wife may feel like she needs to go and get her hair died blue/grey, but it is another suggestion.If I had to go with what you offered, I agree with coolguyky7 and go with the Avalon.

Here's my take on your choices:BMW 525i - Great drivers car for interstate and twisties, classy, power, good family car, but probably not 8 years of trouble free reliability.Lexus GS300 - Great drivers car for interstate and good for twisties (even with the I-6), classy and stylish (IMO), good power, good family car, great reliability.Lexus ES300 - Great drivers car for interstate and adequate for twisties, ok styling (IMO), good power, good family car, great reliability.MB C240 - Great drivers car for interstate and good for twisties, classy and stylish (IMO), adequate power, good family car but probably not 8 years of trouble free reliability.Volvo S60 - I don't know all that much about this one but would think similar to the others with again questionable reliability for 8 years.My opinion is to go with the GS300.

You say the ES300 looks perfect on paper. You also say you want something fun to drive. Now, I have not driven a new ES300, but I have never heard anyone describe the front wheel drive ES300 (fancied up Camry--and I don't say that to be mean, just look at it!) as ""fun to drive."" I think your answer was not on your list. You are considering a used BMW 5-Series or new M-B C-Class. The answer:a new BMW 3-Series. I know, you're thinking they are too small. I used to think that as well until I looked at one and compared the numbers. The 3-Series is larger than the C-Class. It has the same leg and head room as a 5-Series--the 5-Series has about an inch more hip room over the 3-Series, and that's about it. Make sure you order the Sport Package to get the good tires, better wheels and sport seats. It will meet your fun to drive requirement for sure (IMO). I assume you want an automatic since you like the ES300. You should be able to get a 325i with auto, premium package and sport package in the $34k range--and an equally equipped 330i around $39k.

If you are willing to spend about 30k for a car, wouldn't it make more sense to buy a brand new one than a 3 year old car?

Have fun driving as many cars as you can--that's the fun part of the buying process. I would be surprised if the back of the 3-Series was not adequate--as compared to the ES300. The 3er gives up an inch of head room and about 1-1/2 inches of shoulder room to the ES300, and that's about it. Plus, the ES300 does not carry the Edmunds' ""Editor's Most Wanted"" or ""Consumer's Most Wanted"" logos as the 3er does. The BMW dealers here in Atlanta usuallu go about 5% above invoice, so see what they can do. I figure a 325i with auto, Premium Package, Sport Package, metallic paint, Xenon headlights and the Harmon/Kardon premium stereo should be abut $33,700 at 5% above invoice. Good luck!

Claywater does bring up some good points, especially the one about driving as many cars as you can for as long as you can. For me the 3-series IS too small. I'm not all that tall (6'-2""), but I also have 2 kids and know that they can take up more room than I can sometimes imagine. The GS does give you more interior room with a larger trunk. It also gives you better hp/weight ratio than the 325. It may not be as glamorous, but go with your gut after you've driven them all. ",Posts: 465,Member

If I'm not mistaken, the 5-Series will be all new next year as well. If not next year, then 2004 for sure. If next year is the last year of the current design, and you don't have 3 kids to haul around, get the 5-Series. The interior of the M-B will be larger if space is more important. One other thing about the 540i; do you really need all that power--especially since you are not getting the manual transmission? I only bring it up because I believe the Inline-6 has more reliability, does it not? I do know that the 2002 BMW 530i was Consumer Reports' highest rated car ever. I don't think you could go wrong either way, though. Drive them both and see what you think. If you go 540, give the 6-speed a test run before you settle for the slushbox! ",Posts: 534,Member

I have been considering trading to a smaller, less expensive car as I adjust to a new (read: tighter) economic situation. Tops on my list of small cars are the Protege and the Civic. I think they are both very attractive cars and reliable. The Civic has better resale value but the Protege can be purchased for less (if I use the S plan) plus there's that tempting 0% financing option. I drive a midsize car now (a Camry V6) and I'm wondering about the adjustment as far as ride and comfort. My one major gripe with my current car is that it doesn't handle as tightly as I would like, it's not very confidence inspiring on sharp turns, etc. And I admit to a yearning for a bit more ... ""pizzazz"" stylewise. But I do appreciate the smooth, quiet ride. I'm not sure how well I will adjust from driving a midsize to a smaller car that will bring a different experience. I have considered refinancing my car to get out of the financing package that I'm in (which I have determined is not an optimal or advantageous program now that I've learned more about car financing). I really want to get out of this program and into a loan with the lower interest rates. And I want to purchase not lease. Hence, my shift to looking a smaller, less expensive cars that I could afford to buy. I'm just not sure which is the better financial deal: a refinance on a larger car that I bought new and maintained perfectly, but which is almost out of warranty and has a potential sludge problem or a fresh start (at an even lower interest rate) with a new vehicle that is smaller, but has a full warranty and no known engine flaws.I moved from a small car (a Saturn) to a midsize because I felt I needed the extra room for family trips. That is no longer true and as a single person with no children (and few passengers), I don't necessarily need the extra room. I do like the way a midsize car feels compared to what I remember from my small car ownership. Of course, I never minded how my small cars felt while I had them. I may now have a different perspective, having experienced a different class of car. I know this is impossible to predict and surely subjective.I know if I trade to a smaller vehicle to cut my expenses, I'll have to make some sacrifices. I'm hoping to buy a vehicle that would require the least amount of sacrifice or just on minor things.Sooo, now that you know my long boring story, what advice/feedback do you have for me? And if it looks as if a trade to a small car might be the best move, which one might be better for me: the Civic or the Protege?Sorry for the long post.TIASilverCrown ",Posts: 237,Member

I guess you have to answer which is more important, style or reliability, but I would recommend the Civic. IMO, the Protege is a better looking vehicle, but the track record on the Civic is better. I'm not saying that the Civic can't be sporty or that the Protege isn't reliable, but maybe for you this is a time to be more practical than anything else. I would even suggest that if money is a major concern look at a 2 year old Civic until you get your feet under you and your bearings straight. Then in a couple of years when your loan (I'm assuming) is paid off go with a vehicle that is more sporty. Both will give you a more crisp ride than the Camry and they will feel just as quick.You also need to weigh if you can hold on until your current car is paid off. If you can I would suggest that you do this rather than buy anything. The Camry will hold its value especially if you've maintained it like you suggest. Then after it's paid off you can put that monthly payment away or towards whatever you need.Finally, what about the Corolla? If you want to stay in the Toyota family this might be another alternative.Good luck, it sounds like this is a rough time for you. ",Posts: 465,Member

It's funny, but I've never been too fond of the Corolla even though I've always liked the Civic. And I really don't like the latest style of the Corolla. That's why I left it off the list.The problem with my financing is that even when the term is up, I won't own this car. It a sort of lease/loan hybird thing at my credit union that sounded great at the time, but it is really an unattractive long-term lease. It appeared to allow me to be able to afford the Camry V6 (a car that I've always admired), but I'm paying dearly for that decision now.I'm thinking of either refinancing it into a regular loan if I can(at a lower interest rate) or starting over with another (smaller) car, financed with a straight loan and at a low interest rate. My goal is to reduce my monthly payments and insurance premiums. I still have nearly 2 more years to struggle under this program with payments that were OK 3 years ago, but are a strain right now. So I'm thinking that I really need to do something different to bring some relief. I just don't know what is the best course of action that makes the most sense and where I'm not totally miserable.Thanks for the advice and the well wishes. ",Posts: 237,Member

I would have to say the Protege would be the better buy, for a few reasons. First, you say you are ""tightening"" your expenses. Well, by your own admission, the Protege is less expensive. Second, you mention wanting a car that is fun to drive--highlighting the car's ability to handle. Well, I feel the Protege is most famous for its handling and is deemed to be more fun to drive than Civics and Corollas. One big car magazine said the Protege had ""BMW verve for half the price."" Or something like that. Third, someone else said that even though the Protege is a better looking car, you should get the Civic because it is more reliable. Well, the days of the bullet proof Civic seem to be over. This current generation seems to be having some problems. The 2001 Civic was downgraded to Average reliability by Consumer Reports from the Better than Average reliablity of previous generations. Also, Consumer Reports says to expect Average reliability out of the 2002 Civic (designated with the clear circle with no coloring at all). The 2002 Protege was listed as Much Better than Average reliability (designated with the full red circle). I don't think you would go wrong with the Civic; but, the Protege will offer a better driving experience (IMO) with better anticipated reliability--at a better price. ",Posts: 534,Member

You echo my thoughts so far exactly. The only thing about the Protege is that it looks as if it will be quite a bit more expensive to insure than the Civic. I got a rough estimate from my insurance company (who I just switched to because it was cheaper for me) and the quote for the Protege was about $200 more per year. It was even higher than the premium for my Camry! Although my Camry is older, it cost a lot more. (but I'm really not sure how all this works and so many factors come into play here). Of course this was a very rough estimate, but it makes me wonder if my savings on the price of the car would be offset by higher insurance costs.But other than that issue, everything else that you say points to the Protege as being the better buy.Why does this have to be so hard ...... **sigh** ",Posts: 237,Member

The major reason behind my thinking on this issue is cost, cutting my expenses to a more comfortable level. So I'm looking at every thing in a different way and a few dollars are more meaningful to me at this point than they usually would be.On the other hand, after I left work, I was thinking about the whole potential increase in my insurance premium if I traded my Camry for a Protege and something occurred to me. That possible increase in my insurance could be offset by what I would save in gasoline costs every month. I use premium in my V6 and I think the Protege only needs regular. Plus, I'll probably use less gas with the higher mileage of the Protege. So the whole thing may be a wash. These may be small, insignificant points to most, but these little details are important. Most of the time it's the little details that get you when you overlook them.Plus, if I can get the 0% financing, I should still come out with lower monthly expenses with the Protege. I have excellent credit, so I should be able to get it, unless Mazda has totally unreasonable guidelines to get that rate. And if I use the Ford S-plan discount (I have no idea how that works), I might be sitting pretty with this deal.Whew!! I feel better having thought this out some more.

My understanding is that the S-plan is the Ford employee/retiree discount program for Mazdas and the X-plan is a non-Ford employee discount program for Ford and all of their subsidiaries, including Mazda.

I don't work for Ford Motor, but we have a ""partnership"" with them.I think the Ford employee discount programs for Ford/Lincoln/Mercury are called A and Z plans for current employees and retirees respectively.

This discount, plus the 0% interest rate program is part of what would make the Mazda Protege an attractive alternative.

I am looking for a new car (2002 or 2003?? -- evenconsidering 2001-maybe lower monthly payments!?)I have a 1997 Grand Am (final payment next month!!)-nice car but having a few problems with it, especially lately. Therefore, I've put all GM cars on the back burner, even though I like the Oldsmobile Alero, but V6 has rather steep monthly payments even with 1.9% financing (5 yrs.)I've ""narrowed it down"" to 4 cars (first time looking at foreign models!!):-Honda Accord SE (4 cyl. or 6--monthly payments a little too high for the 6, but worried about winter road handling with 4 cyl.)--4.8% financing (5yrs.)-Chrysler Sebring (V6)-nice car but not as many options as Honda (2.8% for 5 yrs.)-Dodge Intrepid (V6)-rather big, but handles well and great financing (0% for 5 yrs.)-Nissan Maxima-heard a lot of good things about it, but didn't visit this dealer yet--don't know prices or available financing.Bottom line: I want a good, reliable car (that won't start breaking down a few months after purchase), around the same size as Grand Am or little smaller, starts well in winter, handles well on winter roads and reasonably priced!Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

You might want to look at the Sentra. They tend to be bulletproof relieable, last forever and can be fun to drive with the right setup. The Altima is getting so much attention that the Nissan dealers might be willing to deal on the more neglected and posssibly slow moving Sentras. Those Nissan engines are something.Insurance. Try four or five different companies. Some penalize the Pro. because previously it was considered more of a hot rod than the civic or Sentra (It had a 1.8L, while the civic and sentra had 1.5l-1.6l engines). The civic is a bit more expensive to repair and tends to be popular with thieves, so some agents will penalize it. If insurance cost is a biggie, you might find that the sentra is a sleeper here. Because of its rather dull image, some agents might not realize that some versions are hot.Another fun-to-drive car would be a used subaru impreza. You get AWD good handling and comfort, but smallish trunk. Buying used would make all of the other cars more economical as well (financing and insuring).good luck in whatever you choose.

Your Grand Am is considered a compact car at 186"". The Accord-189"", Sebring-191"", and Maxima-192"" are considered midsize. The Intrepid-204"" is full size. The main imports in your size range would be a Subaru Legacy-184"" or a VW Passat-185"". Smaller, would be subcompacts: Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra and Subaru Imprezza (all 174-178"" and thousands cheaper with similar room, but less power than the mid and fullsize models).If you want looks, go with the Sebring or Intrepid. If you want reliability go with the Accord or Maxima. Power is a tossup with a slight edge to the Maxima in base form and the Accord bringing up the rear. All will be fine in the winter, but if you are obsessed about winter (and willing to pay just a little more for the peace of mind) buy one of the Subarus (great winter grip with standard awd, well equipped, but with standard 4 banger engines in the econo price range)Have fun test driving them all. BTW, I strongly recommend you give the Chevy Impala a look. Its reliable, well equipped, great power and handling, good financing terms, huge trunk and its only 200"" (Its considered a midsize). A lot of car for the money. Its not the best looker, but it grows on you. You might decide to give GM a second chance.:.)You can find good deals on any of these, just remember that if you want the lowest possible price, you probably won't get all of the features,the biggest engine or biggest car.

Get the Accord. Now is a good time to buy the 2002 since the newly-designed 2003 will be out in September. It will have several improvements. If you wanted to wait for it, the price will be higher for the first several months than the 2002. The 4 is fine for normal driving and also for winter driving. The 2002 is one of the very best cars for all-around driving according to ""Consumer Reports"" and others. The Nissan will be more money and not nearly as economical.

My '97 Grand Am has been giving me various problems: wiring, continuous flashing high beam light, ABS brakes, alternator, and considerable paint chipping!It also has to start well on very cold days (Grand Am great for this--never has to be plugged in!), and handle well on highways (we get long winters with many bad snowstorms) because I do a lot of highway driving.Finally, it has to be reasonably priced--I can't afford $600/mth. payments!It would be nice if it had a few options (not totally loaded but not basic either) and was ""roomy"" enough (that's why I don't want to go VERY SMALL if I look at compact cars, too).I'm looking forward to your suggestions and thank you all again!

You can argue this all day until your face goes blue. I think both cars are excellent.

Clarify ""roomy"". Most cars are roomy enough in the front. The back seat is where you tend to lose the most room in smaller cars. This is not so importantant if the back seat is used only by pets or small children, more important if you carpool or have have teenagers with long legs. If you have children, take them with you on your test drives to try out the size of the back seat. They might tilt your decision.Compacts: Passat, a comfortable, roomy, good looking and handling car but a bit expensive and with questionable long term reliability. You nixed the Subaru Legacy based on no subaru dealers. That only leaves maybe the Olds Alero which is similar in size and reliability to your Grand Am. It does have a long warranty. It is being discontinued.The Accord is probably your best bet in the midsize although a little noisy. The Altima is faster with a rather plain, but roomy interior and a beautiful exterior. Some say that it is noisy and has a firm ride. The Camry is quietest and rides most comfortably but does not handle as well as the others. The Maxima is fast, handles well, but has a rather firm ride. All are reliable with the Camry probably the most and the Altima the least, which is still excellent.Btw, most people purchase these cars with 4 banger engines, except for the Max which has a 6 cyl. standard. The fours have plenty of power, get great highway mpg and are much cheaper to buy. They are not as quiet or as powerful as V6 engines.Check out the subcompacts if your money is really tight. Most of them are less than a foot shorter than your Grand Am. Their front headroom and front legroom is basically the same as the midsize cars and they get much better mpg because their 4 cylinder engines are smaller than those in the midsize cars, but since the cars weigh less they still perform well.Go test drive those that interest you. Its your money and in the final analysis, you'll need to make up your own mind. Remember to give the Impala or maybe the Monte Carlo a look. ",Posts: 114,Member

I'm sure you're right about the tires as the Camry is a quality car.

I believe that people would be looking for things to be wrong on the Sonata; and, if something outside of the control of the car itself went wrong, people will still blame the Sonata as being junk.

A short while back, I posted a message here regarding advice on a buying a small car to possibly replace my 2000 Camry V6 to reduce my expenses. I was thinking about a Civic or a Protege (neither of which I have test driven yet). A couple of people suggested the Corolla. I rejected that idea because I haven't really been a fan of its looks in recent years. The older ones were okay, though.I am driving a 2003 Corolla for today (while my Camry is having its 30K maintenance) and all I can say is: dang, this is a Corolla? I haven't driven it a whole lot, but it has really impressed me so far. It is very roomy for a small car, it handles well and accelerates like it has a V6 engine or something. The ride is also very smooth, not quite like my Camry, but very close considering its size. The interior is very nice, it's nicer than my car with wood trim and a higher quality cloth upholstery. Double Dang. :-)As is my prerogative, I have changed my mind about the Corolla. If I ever decide to buy a small car, it is at the top of my list, based on my experience today. Plus, it has leather and alloy wheel options that still have a TMV under $18K. It is not only like a baby Camry, but approaching a baby Lexus with more luxury than you would expect. Triple Dang.Even the styling, which is very similar to the new Camry, seems to work on this car. Personally, I'm not fond of the Camry's new styling, but it actually looks pretty nice on the smaller Corolla. It's actually kinda cute. Or maybe my opinion has been swayed by how nice it is otherwise. I was not prepared to like this car (quite the opposite, actually) and it has exceed all of my expectations. Maybe I'm easy to please (NOT!) but I like this car. It is not my father's Corolla. LOLI'm leaning toward refinancing my Camry and keeping it. I think it would be too costly to try and trade it. But my next car just may be a Corolla. Especially if it keeps getting bigger and better over time. ",Posts: 237,Member

Just got my Motor Trend in and saw the new Accord. Nice looking but the back is a little funky. The picture of the dash looked really cool! It was a 6 cylinder model, will be interested to see the 4 banger model close up. Will probaly give the Camry a run for the money.But really, the Camry and Accord do set the standard for the American family 4 door sedan hands down.

We drove the Camry, Accord, and Altima back to back within a 2 hour span and the wife chose the Altima to buy, said after 2 Camrys, wanted a change.

He had never (at least I don't think) driven a Camry before renting one a couple of weeks ago. He came here with a glowing review and said he would buy one today if he were in the market for such a sedan with no quesions asked. He then said that the only bad thing was the bad handling in the rain--and said the issue was the result of bad tires. My contention was simply that had the rental car in question been a Sonata and everything else was exactly the SAME, the review probably would have read ""Don't buy a Sonata, they are dangerous to drive."" But, as I said before, it doesn't matter anyway. Not trying to start another ""Hyundai vs."" thread. ",Posts: 534,Member

I understood you correctly the first time, but you misunderstood me. My point was simply that it is human nature to overlook faults when the product has a long and good track record and likewise, nitpick and find fault at the slightest opportunity when the product has a shady past. That is why even the exact same shortcoming would be interpreted differently based on the product. Hope this is clear. ",Posts: 438,Member

Hi guysI need desperately your help!For many months, I have been thinking about what car I could buy. Finally, I've decided tobuy a 2001 VW Jetta. I love how the car looks like, and the quietness while you're driving.I have to drive 90 miles every day, so I thought that this is the car for me.However, I have been reading many user reviews about this car, and I have noticed that there isa very common complaint about that the car sometimes rattles at a specific speed. Also, other minorproblems.Now, I'm completely lost! I don't know what to do. Do you guys recommend me this car?What other options do you think I should consider? I don't want to spend more that $15000 fora car (used). I don't see other cars that I like! People have recommend me to get a Honda or Toyota, butI haven't found one of them that really satisfy me.Ford Mustang was another option... but I need to drive a lot every day, and maybe this is not thebest car for me.Thanks a lot for your comments.PS Thanks to claywaterfill for his comments in the other forum  ",Posts: 2,Member

I'm trying to decide between the Civic EX and the Jetta GLS (2.0 liter). There's a pretty big price difference, so I don't know what to do! I love the design of the Jetta and thought the ride was smoother. I learned to drive on my parents' '90 Accord, so I feel comfortable with Hondas. I've thought about the Corolla, but our local Toyota dealership isn't the greatest. Does anyone have any advice? Why should I spend $2500 or so more for the Jetta? Thanks! ",Posts: 1,Member

Just buy the one you are comfortable with. I believe the Jetta is the ""nicer"" of the two, but over the long haul, it's hard to go wrong with a Honda. I would suggest to you, like I did to staryon, to try the Corolla and Protege. The current generation Civics--according to sources like Consumer Reports--do not seem to share the bulletproof reliability of previous generations. The Protege starts around 12 grand with air and CD and is getting higher reliability marks than the Civic is now. The Corolla starts around $13,800 with automatic, air and CD and has been the reliability leader in this segment for many years. If fun to drive is the most important, I would still go with Protege as its ""claim to fame"" seems to be its handling and driveability. I do feel the Jetta is the best looking fo the bunch--and it gives that nice German feel. Just figure out what you are looking for and go with that. You are the one who has to drive it, so you might as well get what you like. Good luck. ",Posts: 534,Member

Interesting to note that the Civic is still rated as one of the 'best pick' by CR in compact sedans, despite the alleged reliability flaws that's been commented by so many.Having a 99 Civic, the only flaw I see is with Honda using cheaper materials for the newer Civic's interior.If you can afford a Jetta, then buy it. I think it's safe to assume that if you liked the Jetta for its styling and features, you'll quickly get bored by the Civic. ","Posts: 2,286",Member

The V6 in your 626 had 170hp to move a nearly 3000 lb car, the Accord I-4 has 160hp moving a 3050 lb car. Numbers wise I don't think you'll notice much. The litmus test,as with all 4 cylinders, is when you have 4 people in it with the A/C on and you need to pass.

Ok, background. I have a long commute (60 mi each way, 50+ of which is highway) on a job I just got a few months ago. New job and damaged credit I've been rebuilding for 3 years now makes financing anything tough.Current car:Red 93 Corsica with 47k miles on it, owned for just over a year, swapped tires and a couple of minor electrical repairs (turn signal switch, power window switch), and the A/C just sprung a leak.

Will this car keep me on the road relatively hassle free, assuming it's been maintained?I'm expecting I'll only get about $2k in trade for my car, or maybe get $2.5k if I can find a private buyer, am I being rational?I strongly dislike my current car and would like a move on efficiency, reliability and miles eating ability, but tight budget makes that questionable.Thoughts?

I personally would probably run the Corsica for awhile and stash away some money. You're not going to lose much if any value by stacking on some miles. It will cost you a bit in fuel and possibly some repairs (a six year old Mazda could break-down as well). A '97 Protege isn't exactly leaps and bounds nicer than anything, so throwing out $3500 to get into another small car doesn't seem prudent. Why not hang on to what you've got until the baby comes along and then maybe you'll have enough cash (or better credit) to get into something more reasonable. A nice 4cyl Camry/Accord would be much more comfortable to haul around a baby, plus still get excellent gas mileage and good reliability. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

 HP numbers can be deceiving. For example, I had an Integra(auto) supposedly with 142HP or so. The thing could barely get out of it's way. In fact, all the Honda 4 cyl autos(including a VTEC in a civic) that I have driven, needed to be revved real hard before any power would materialise. Absolutely no power at lower RPMs. If you are used to a V6 , this may quickly get tiresome. Make sure you drive the car throughly before buying.jimsxnYou may want to try a Mazda protege.

Hello friends:I'd appreciate your input as I cannot decide between these two. I am turning in my C240, the lease is up soon. The new version can be had in four-wheel drive. I am going to lease my next car for three years.I like the MB exterior better than the Lexus, but the ES300 is superior on the inside, I believe.I have liked my C240 except for two things: the seats aren't too comfortable, and the interior is on the small side. I occasionally drive with my two teenage sons in the back seat (but have a van too so size not a huge factor).I know these cars have very different rides, would just like your opinions.

it really comes down to personal preferences at this point. The MB looks a lot better to me than the Lexus, but I think the Lexus has it on interior comfort/design. The entry level luxuries are a bit of a quandry to me, but if I was looking for one I think the Audi A4 (has AWD option also) or Infiniti G35 would be serious contenders over either. Concerning size, you could also pony up a bit more for an audi A6 which is really comfortable, excellent interior, option of quattro, etc. Yeah I'm an Audi fan. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I presume you have freeway/highway miles for an 85 mi. commute.

Expecially after seeing what happens when someone is rear-ended in one of these little cars by a pickup or SUV. Yes, the gas mileage suffered but I walked away from one wreck in a full size Chevy.

I have full no deductible GM Protection Plan on my 99 Blazer. The plan obviously does not cover tires and batteries.Early this week the alternator shorted and completely destroyed the battery. GM only paid for alternator --- even though it is the alternator that killed a brand new battery.Also, I am taking this 3 and 1/2 and 47,000 miles old Blazer to mechanic almost every month now. Transmission leaks, shorted alternator, fuel line contamination problems, broken sit recliner lever, weather stripes falling off, rattling interior, and the list goes on and on. GM Protection Plan, my no deductible complete plan, that I bought for $1700 does not cover most of the expenses. On top of this GM roadside service advised me to call AAA for roadside assistance --- what a joke! My Protection Plan is supposed to include roadside assistance up to 5 yr/ 75000 miles.Anyway, I am not too upset. I have paid off fully for this vehicle and I wish to hang on to it. But, GM and the uncooperative Chevy dealers are making my life difficult. Chevy dealers I know love to take the side of GM whenever I request them to check if the protection plan could cover a little more.Reliability also is an issue now. If the vehicle starts breaking down too often, I will trade it in for an import. GM will lose a loyal customer, who has driven 3 GM cars, for good. I can't help. I'm really in no mood to allow GM to force extremely poor reliability and customer service on me any more.My advice will be to stay away for GM vehicles. ",Posts: 17,Member

I'm not a big GM fan or anything, but they make some decent vehicles. The Blazer was not one of these. I found them quite crappy when new, and anytime you see one with many miles on them they are garbage. I know of one person that bought a '97 and within three years and 100K miles it was completely falling apart. Highway miles shouldn't wear out a vehicle like that. The newer Tahoes/burbans (which i own), the Impala, are fairly nice and well built vehicles. The Malibu is pretty good for the money.  None of those vehicles would scare me as I know quite a few folks that have racked up serious miles on them. You just have to be careful with what you buy. I've owned three Camrys and the newest one was by far the worst, not only in mechanical means but just a cheaper built vehicle. But you do get what you pay for. A Blazer is darn cheap compared to some import SUV's so keep that in mine. Picking up a cheap import may not get you anywhere. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I've had/have quite a few vehicles including heavy duty trucks/suvs. I live very far out and 4X4 is practically required when it snows. Some 4X4's don't make it up a couple of these hills without some good tires. So I have to drive a 4X4 quite a bit anyway. I run a Cherokee which you'd be surprised at how quick these can be with just a few mods. Not going to turn high speed numbers, but acceleration is quite good and with some suspension tweaks and good summer tires the handling/braking rivals or in some instances better than a Camry. So far the Jeep has been just as reliable and cheaper on the maintenance side than the Camrys. Costs me about 4mpg. I just threw on my winter tires last week and the handling is slopped up a bit, but I can still run pretty quick. I don't do 4cyls very well. Too many hills where torque is king.

The luxury board was not much help. I am at the beginning of a search for a luxury car. My first since about age 28.

I'm working on a replacement for our '99 VW New Beetle (lease is up next month and with 2 teenagers, it's just not practical anymore). I've narrowed it down to two vehicles. Let me run down my elimination process:VW Jetta - too smallVW Passat - too expensiveHonda Accord - don't like the looks with the redesigned '03Toyota Camry - ""an old person's car"" - quote from wifeThe two I've narrowed it down to are the Nissan Altima 2.5S and the Saturn L300 (both with auto transmissions).I know - the first thing you think is ""Hey! He's comparing a 4-cyl Nissan to a V6 Saturn"". Which is true, but consider this:HP: 175 (Nissan), 181 (Saturn)MPG: 23/29 (Nissan), 21/29 (Saturn)So, not much difference. And, my commute is 35 miles each way, with a majority of it coming on divided 4 lane roads or highways.Here's my thinking:Nissan pros: looks, room inside, durability (I've owned Nissans in the past), dealer location.Nissan cons: 4-cyl buzziness, inside cabin materials put me off (the dials and the orange lighting, specifically).Saturn pros: 6-cyl smoothness, inside cabin much nicer (subjective opinion, I know), dent-resistant panels.Saturn cons: dealer location, outside looks, unknown reliability (have heard both great and disturbing things about Saturns from people I know).Prices are close enough for it to not matter in my decision making; on the other hand, the nice finance rate offered by GM is attractive, but only if they decide to extend it beyond 10/31.Thoughts? Opinions? I'm thinking of buying and keeping for 7-10 years this time (I'm ready to get off of the leasing carousel).Thanks in advance for any feedback. ","Posts: 4,300",Member

Since you appear to have a Ford ""X-plan"" available, I suggest you consider Taurus or Sable. Especially with the 200 HP DOHC Duratec, they provide good acceleration, reasonably tight handling but without being punishing and at a bargain price. Mileage is close to the Saturn LS300 V-6 as well. Don't be fooled by the ""rental car"" stigma a lot of people seem to have about them. I think they are well built, solid, and rattle free.

BTW...why dont you take test drive 2003 Honda Accord. Initially I wasn't too crazy about the look of the car; however, the brightly lit speedometer is a great feature! After all you will be spending great deal of time inside of a car.Anyways, good luck with your final decision and please keep us informed! ",Posts: 4,Member

I looked at the 2002 GMC ENVOY during the summer when I was going to buy something. I can't remember if it was the price you want. The car was highly rated by any magazine that counts and my driving it seemed to confirm those reports. This was the only SUV that really appealed to me. If I had decided to buy, it would have been mine. They were having deals on it at the time, so that might reduce the price unless you fall for the low interest rates instead. ",Posts: 4,Member

Other than the looks, I have one other obstacle with the Honda: my spouse. For some unknown reason, she's got this thing against Honda's.

Altima vs Saturn L - I'd take the Saturn. If looks were the only criteria, I'd choose the altima. In fact, loved the looks so much I checked one out last spring. Boy was I disappointed when I got in and drove it. Very poor interior, cheap feel, and the 2.5 was lame. The car felt very tinny.The Saturn 3.0 is a cut above, while the HP isn't mcuh more, the torque makes a difference. (I wish it was available with the 5 speed.) Interior and overall feel are also better. I have three friends with Saturns, all who love them. The best man from my wedding is shopping for an L series to replace his '94 SC2 which has 170,000 miles.Regarding the small SUV, I'd go with the escape or a Jeep Liberty. However, don't count out the Subaru for repair expenses or difficulty. It's doubtful you'll ever have a problem, they are tops for reliability...underrated in my opinion. ",Posts: 235,Member

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this. I would agree with coolguyky7 on this one. I would even be more specific as to say go with a Toyota Corolla or the Chevy Prizm (same thing different badging). Probably 1-2 years old so somebody else takes the depreciation hit. Another idea would be the Honda Civic DX or HX. Both of these vehicles will offer you excellent reliability, good gas mileage, good road manners and handling for their size and pricepoint and good resale even 10 years down the road.

Here's my take, the Buick has 240hp out of a supercharged engine in a 3520lb car that has a lazyboy suspension that has been slightly stiffened. It is an attractive and conservative package that has all of the goodies. The Nissan has 190hp out of their engine in a 3001lb car that has (for me) a comfortably firm ride. It is an attractive package that has all of the basic goodies (I'm assuming a GXE). My dad owns a Buick and from what I've seen on it and others is that the fit and finish aren't that good. From what I've been able to find out the Buick is as reliable as the Nissan. The choice is ultimately yours, but I would have to say the Nissan. The safety of the added handling is a plus and the smiles that it will bring when the other seats are empty are worth something also.

I'd second the vote for the Elantra; my wife has an '01 and it's been flawless in over 20K miles so far. Yesterday, we topped off the tank and drive for 90 miles before the guage got down to 'F'.Anyway, some things to consider:- Check insurance rates as some models will be more expensive than others. That V6 you want may cost more in insurance premiums.- Gas and other maintenance items like tuneups are typically a bit more expensive with a 6 cyl vs. a 4.- Modern 4 cyl engines have plenty of power.Good luck.

I'm guess you've never had to experience pure driving excitement with 4 people in a WRX. Don't underestimate the excitement that you can have in the Max.The WRX and the Max are very different vehicles. The WRX is a powerful, fun and exciting car as long as you don't haul more than 2 adults with all of their gear. Yes you can fit more in but comfort becomes an issue (IMO).

I currently have a 92 buick lesabre and have 160,000 miles on it and it still runs great. but due to the fact that I want a new car and that my dad is taking this one I figured it was time to look. I've researched hundreds of sites. Yet I've found cars that I like but I'm afraid because like the Infinity G35 is rear wheel drive. and My father tells me I don't want a RWD car in the winter and they are horrible.

I can tell you first hand, the ""aftermarket"" leather is MILES better than the stock leather from Nissan.I had this done to my Altima 3.5 SE V6 -- I have the invoice... Total cost was $850. The Dealer doesn't actually do it, they sub-contract it out to a local company... I would ask the Dealer if they can tell you who does their leather work, maybe even show you some work (if they have any on site), go to the company and ask to see some of their work, or even ask the Dealer for the phone numbers of a customers who had it done and ask them.As for the ""road noise"", I personally don't notice it whatsoever, but certainly if you're coming from a Buick, you might. As far as I know there's no easy way to correct this, if in fact you find it bothersome in your test drive.The bottom line is you're going to have to go test drive all the vehicles you're interested in -- preferably on the same day -- to try and get as close to a back-to-back comparison as you can.Articles and paper specs are nice -- but your butt in the driver's seat is still the best comparison you can do, IMHO.

We just purchased a Mazda6, and like you we started car shopping several months prior. Our journey took us through the following dealerships and we test drove these vehicles:Lexus - ES300 and IS300Acura - ClMB - C240Volvo -S60Audi - A4BMW - 325iNisson - Maxima and AltimaToyota - SolaraHonda - Accord CoupeHyundai - Tiburon and XG350and Mazda - Mazda6As you can see our budget (and likes) was from the mid 30's to the low 20's, from sporty to luxury, and I kept trying to ask my wife, ""what are you looking for?"" (decisions, decisions). Toward the end of the year it came down to 2 (or 3) vehicles (we decided to go for the under 25k price), and those choices were Honda Accord Coupe (w/navi), or the Camary Solara. Unknown to my wife, I still wanted to see what these new Mazda6 looked like (I hadn't seen it in any of the showrooms yet). It was about mid December when it hit our showrooms (at least that's when I found out it hit our showrooms). I took a test drive and I was hooked, on the looks and the ride. That's when I called my wife (she was out of town), and told her she needs to take a look at the Mazda6. I can say with all sincerity that she never even thought about owning a Mazda. But shortly after she took the ride and saw it for herself, we started to edge out the Solara as a contender. The other issue became a matter of looks. Did we want the coupe (w/navi), or did we want a sporty looking sedan?What's my point? Like the post above from Ultima, take a test drive and see (and feel) for yourself, but don't purchase without first giving the Mazda6 a try.Good luck! ",Posts: 6,Member

I know exactly what you mean. I think most of us have some idea what we want but once we get out there it's really hard to choose. Two of the main things I heard my wife say was, ""I want leather seats"" and ""volume controls for the radio on the steering wheel"". And as I mentioned before we started out looking at a Lexus, and ended up with a Mazda6 we never even heard about? Go figure. Now, take a guess at two of the features the Mazda6 had? :-)Determining what you REALLY want is what I think is the key to narrowing things down. If one is undecided about whether you want luxury, size, sportiness, leather, cloth, 6 disc CD, or single disc., it's going to make anyone's search more difficult. And let's not forget the bottom line question which is, ""how much is all of this going to cost me after tax, title, and license"". And ""will I be able to fill it up EVERY week""?

We've always been intrigued by the Tdi. We like the way it handles but it does have a rather spartan interior (GL version). The fuel mileage is a huge plus. We originally looked at the Jetta TDI sedan, but decided that that for the money, the wagon was more practical (and not as common on the road).With the Accord, we had always felt that was a bit overpriced until we stumbled upon the dealer who might let one go for about $1500 under invoice.

Hi,I'm looking for a sedan that's $30-35,000. I currently drive a Ford Explorer, and want as much winter weather protection as I can get, so I prefer a car with AWD and traction control. I have no sense of direction, so I'd also like a navigation system. This is where everything gets confusing -- because I basically end up with no options by process of elimination.Audi requires the 3.0 engine to get the nav system, and that's around $40,000. And if I give up on the nav system, is the 1.8T underpowered? Another Audi problem: it appears that if you get sports suspension, you don't get all weather tires. Would I really have to buy all weather tires on top of the sport suspension, or can you opt out of the high performance tires?The GLX 4-Motion Passat has almost everything I want, at the right price, but I'd have to give up on the Nav System.The Acura is very nice, but has no AWD.The BMW is too $$$.Any thoughts for me? Anyone with experience on an after-market navigation system?

Thanks for the advice. We had a snowstorm here in Chicago yesterday, so I took the opportunity to drive the S60 AWD ... very nice. Do you have any personal experience with this car? I am interested in the optional traction control, upgraded stereo and navigation system, but the dealer tried to talk me out of the first two because they would be ""special orders.""

Hi, I currently drive a 00 Jetta GLS in Louisiana, which I shall turn in at the end of my lease in few months. I am moving to S. Dakota. I would like to know what car I should be looking at. I am not an off-roading person, and believe that safety is first. I prefer sticks, but MT is not the rule. Anyone care to opine? There is no nearby Volvo or LandRover dealership in Sioux Falls. I prefer a dealership in town (GM, Jeep, Kia, Hyundai, MBenz, Mazda, Honda, Toyota, Audi, VW, Saab). From what I know, I think I may lean towards and AWD or 4WD. (Or is that not necessary?)

I'd add the Jag X-Type to your list. I'm also looking for an AWD and was impressed with the styling. I'm still a little leary on the Jag's reliability but it can't be as bad as the Audi/Passats. Another car I'd consider is the WRX. It'll blow the others away in terms of speed, handling & braking plus it's $10K less. I'm not sure how much luxury you're looking for because leather and climate control isn't available. The ""cheapness"" of the WRX shows when compared to the Audi, M-B, BMW and Jag.Just my opinion...

I have a friend who is looking to replace her problematic Pontiac Grand Prix (1998). She is hoping to get either a 0% deal or a really good lease deal, since she knows that she will be upside down on the transaction. She is determined to trade it in anyway, rather than pouring more money into a car she no longer trusts and she feels was a huge mistake to lease and then buy.Here are some of the constraints. She'd like to stay in a midsized sedan with 6 cylinders (preferably, but not a deal breaker). She's leaning heavily toward GM (Pontiac or Chevy) for the good financing deals. She's not interested in Ford and wants to avoid Chrysler. Her price range is $25-30K (which would include a hefty balance from her old loan) or a lease payment of $300-$350. She likes the idea of an import car (esp. Toyota) but she doesn't think she can get as good of a deal on the financing as with GM. She considers this an ""in between"" vehicle to get out of the Grand Prix and until she can afford something that she really wants to keep (she really likes the Toyota Highlander).So, as you can see, there are a lot of factors to consider, which makes it more difficult for me to advise. Personally, I'd steer her toward Toyota, Honda or Nissan and I told her that. I also mentioned Mazda, particularly the new Mazda6, but she's afraid to buy a first year model. My thoughts, given her situation, if she's determined to trade now, would be to buy a used midsize car, like a Camry or an Accord (she doesn't want to buy used, though) or a new small car. I'm leaning toward a recommendation for the new Corolla, as a nice, reliable car, which should have fewer problems, even though it's smaller and not as ""sporty"" as the Grand Prix.She is willing to consider the Corolla, and that's the only small car that she would consider. That's only because she likes Toyota, but she's not crazy about the style of the new Camry. I have a 2000 Camry, and I really can't blame her, but the similar style seems to work better on the smaller Corolla IMHO. Plus, I've driven the new Corolla and it was much nicer than I expected, so I was able to give her some positive feedback from my personal experience with the Corolla. We seem to share quite a few of the same opinions in regards to cars, so I'm thinking that if I liked the Corolla, she might too. In the end, she'll have to drive it and see for herself.After our conversation, we came up with this list:1)Toyota Corolla (my pick so far)2)Pontiac Grand Am (I think this is her favorite)3)Saturn L-Series (may be too expensive w/o haggling)4)Chevy Impala (may be too big, it's a full size)I tried to choose some of the better ""midsized"" offerings from GM, since she's leaning toward that direction anyway. She drove a Malibu before and didn't like it. Buick is not an option either (I threw that out there, just to be thorough, and of course, it was shot down, no surprise there).I also mentioned the new Accord, but she hasn't seen it yet, so she doesn't know if she will like the new styling of it. Personally, I'm not too wild about it's current styling either (I've mostly liked the styling of the Camry and the Accord until the latest versions) but I'll try not to introduce that bias to her. I plan to print out some photos for her to look at and if she likes it, it will probably go to the top of the list, especially if Honda has some good financing deals for it. I don't know how likely that is, though. Maybe someone here has some info on that. (hopefully) :-)I am doing some research and comparisons for her, to help her make a decision. But I thought it would be good to put this ""dilemma"" on the boards. Especially as it pertains to good financing and leasing deals. I know it sounds a bit unusual, but I really want to help her make the best decision that she can be happy with. Any and all input is very welcome.Thanks in advance. Sorry for the long post. :-)SilverCrown ",Posts: 237,Member

Taurus. Good value and can be purchased loaded new for well south of $20K, or a lower equipped LX or SE version for under $15K-16K. Keep it long, and depreciation means little! Or, a decently equipped short wheel base Caravan for under $20K.Corolla may be OK if she can go that small. I am not a Grand Am or Saturn L series fan. Impala is a decent car and reasonably inexpensive unless you load it up.Of course, I may be biased, but who isn't when it comes to cars!If she is not going to keep it very long, perhaps she should lease, then there will be no emotional problems if it turns into a lemon, just turn it back when the lease is up and before the warranty is up.

That's a good suggestion. You make some good points. I'll show her your response and see what she thinks. It's hard because she has so many constraints and cars that she doesn't even want to consider right now. Plus, she has access to a GM discount, which is part of the reason why she's focusing on their products. But for the size and price, styling aside (which is very subjective anyway), the Taurus might be a good alternative for her. I think she's pretty set on leasing so that she can save for something that she really wants to keep long-term next time.Anyone know what lease deals Ford is offering for the Taurus? ",Posts: 237,Member

February 2003 ",badgerfan,"
I have no idea about leasing, I keep my cars a long time thus leasing makes no sense. However, since Taurus is sold a lot to fleets (nothing necessarily wrong with that, by the way), there are a lot available on the used market, which causes more depreciation than some of the foreign nameplates. Thus, my guess is that you may lease at a better rate some of the import brands that don't depreciate as fast. If she wants to consider a slightly used Taurus, her buy price would really be a bargain. Lately I have seen a lot of ads where they will throw in an extended engine/drive train warranty on these newer model Tauri as well. If she doesn't like Taurus styling, Mercury Sable is basically the same car with a more ""formal"" exterior sheet metal treatment.With the economy sucking wind and automakers still pushing product out the plants, there are a lot of good deals around, both new and used.

I agree that her best bet might be to buy used, if she really wants a midsize car. I'm sure she could get a very good price for a Taurus. She has her heart set on buying new, perhaps feeling that a new car will be more reliable from the start than a used one. She may change her mind, before it's all said and done, though. We shall see.Thanks for your input. Keep the feedback coming!! ",Posts: 237,Member

Doing some advance scouting for an economy sedan for that day when my present car dies ('84 with 160K miles). Minimum requirements: 4+ doors, MT, air, power windows. Just need for short commute and around-town driving.Did some poking around and decided to check out the Accent/Elantra, Corolla, Civic, Sentra and Protege. Thought about the Focus but concerned about the reliability. Test drove a Protege5, Corolla CE, Sentra GXE, Elantra GT, Sentra SE-R Spec V and Civic EX. Here are my impressions:Protege5 - handles great. Power pretty decent, enough for me. Motor noise is a bit loud esp. at higher revs and you can feel the vibration through the steering wheel/shifter. Shift action is pretty good. Nice interior and pretty cool looking car. Price a bit on the high side. Overall pretty good package.Corolla CE - pretty good pick-up. Handling a bit on the light side. Pretty solid feel overall. Looks OK. Like the reliability (have an '87 Tercel still going strong). Shifter action was poor - kind of rubbery.Sentra GXE - fast enough, maybe a tad slower than the Protege. Handling kind of light. Ride is noisy and unrefined. Big problem: The shifter is horrible, worst by far of the group. Looks are neutral.Elantra GT - decent pick-up, car felt pretty quick. Shifter action is good. Handling pretty good but maybe a bit on the light side, not as good as Protege. Didn't really get to open it up, will probably go for another test drive. Like the looks of the car. Price is right. Great warranty but concerned about re-sale value.SE-R Spec V - not originally in the list but noticed it's around the same price as Protege and higher HP. (Wanted to try SE-R but can't find it in a MT). Great power and acceleration. Almost feels as fast as WRX I test drove a few years ago. Handling a bit disappointing - was expecting it to be tighter than it was. Will take another test drive to make sure. Looks are OK/neutral. Reliability a bit of a concern. The price tag is kind of high compared with the others. Would also need to spring for an extra set of winter tires + steel wheels, pushing price even higher.Civic EX - Very smooth ride, quiet and refined. Very little vibration in steering wheel or shifter. Shifter action is very good. Handling is very good. Car had driver armreset accessory which is nice. Like the reliability and re-sale value. The down-side: power. Car just feels underpowered. Also a bit pricey compared with the others, esp. given the power.Well at this point I'm down to the Elantra GT, Protege5 and SE-R Spec V. The Corolla and Civic are great cars - if I was getting an automatic would probably go with the Corolla, but the MT stinks. Civic just doesn't have enough juice. SE-R Spec V might be too high priced - it's a rocket but I don't need that much power. So I'm kind of leaning toward the Elantra GT or Protege5.Would also consider the Accent GT (even though not a four-door, just because of the price) but haven't found a dealer that has one with MT.That's about it - Help Me Choose!

Of the choices you listed, I'd go Civic. However, have you considered anything like an alero? You may be surprised to know you can get a GX with a MT, sport package for about 13 grand, or less ($750) if you opt for a 3 year warranty instead of 5 years. I noticed that you were mentioning shift quality and handling, as well as power. The alero excels here...very solid and good fuel economy. I bought one last year and am still impressed with it.

I too was a bit cautious about buying a GM, as this was my first GM. However, I know a few people with aleros, and none had any problems. My alero has the new ecotec 4 cylinder and is incredibly smooth...much better than the old quad 4. It also has good torque, which I appreciate. if you change your own oil, you will appreciate the design and position of the oil filter cartridge. The car is reasonably roomy, and a large trunk. It definitely was a step up from other cars in it's price range. I also considered an Impala for it's roominess and smooth ride, but the wife chose the Alero due to the manual tranny. This car has been performed perfectly, and fit and finish was flawless...something that surprised me a bit given all the GM bashing that seems to go on. This was my first GM, but I would definitely buy one again, and hate to see this car go away in 2004. ",Posts: 235,Member

After having several unreliable, old beaters in a row, on which I've spent thousands of dollars on repairs, I am preparing to buy an inexpensive ($15k tops) sedan. The cars I'm considering, even a little bit:Toyota CorollaHonda CivicMazda ProtegeHyundai ElantraNissan SentraSo far, I'm leaning toward the Corolla. Why? Better warranty and more power and standard equipment, at least on the base models, than Civic. I might consider a Protege or Sentra at the right price, though the Pro is getting a bit long in the tooth and both resale and dealer network are weak. Sentra is ugly and a bit cramped. The Elantra is a great value, but I'm not convinced their quality is up where it should be. Again, dollar for dollar, they're extremely tempting, especially with that warranty, though resale is bad. Focus? No, I've heard too many nightmares, though they have a dealer very near my house and I could probably pick one up cheaply. Cavaliers with a/c and stereo are everywhere for $10k, but I don't think I could live with myself. Am I missing any? BTW, I'd strongly prefer a manual transmission, I live in the city, my parking is OK, gas mileage is important. My only real requirements equipment-wise are a/c and a stereo. ","Posts: 2,628",Member

I just bought a Silver 6i this past Tuesday and it is without a doubt the best car I've ever driven that's under $40k. I test drove four or five models with all transmission choices and engines. I decided on the 6i because the 160hp is very fun to play with and the gas mileage is just right: 420 miles to a tank. I passed a guy the other day in an A4 and he was gawking and followed me for a while to get a better look at my 6. It's so fun to drive and I love the styling.

Word to the wise. VW automatic transmissions are crap. I had my 1996 Jetta GL automatic transmission replaced (noticed it sliiping at 60k miles) under warranty at 99,000 miles (went as long as I could with it). Currently have 170,000 and it is time to buy again. A new transmission in a VW is $4,000 and nobody works on them. Also replaced the moonroof motor, all engine gaskets, wheel bearings, entire exhaust ($600+), and fuel injector at or around the 110,000 mile mark. If you need a high mileage car look elsewhere, keeping it for 5 years maximum and under 100,000 miles then take a look. The Passat and Camry are both pricey, the Passat has more of a European feel to it and the Camry is more sedate in its ride like an American cruiser. I'd take the Camry first with what I know about the two cars. Do you think VW knows about their tranny problem? I do, its why you no longer see 10 yr 100,000 mile power train warranties, note the Passat's goes 5 yrs, 50k. Besides those two vehicles, I would recommend taking a long hard look at the new Accord V-6 or Chrysler 300M (that's right, a Chrysler), both are more reliable then the Passat will be and Chrysler is discounting the remaining 2003 300M's by $3,000! Invoice on an M is $26,400, so now the car is priced in the mid-size sedan range. ",Posts: 8,Member

Not sure if you are still with us since I just saw your post from 4-14.For your daughter's first car you want something with more metal around her. For around $4K look at early or mid-90s Accords, Camrys or Maximas. You may be able to find some good buys with under 100K miles on them for that price, and if they were well maintained they should go at least another 50 to 100K. I believe most of those models tested well in the crash tests.They also handle well, and they are among the most reliable cars on the road. I have a '92 Maxima that still runs great with 111K on it, and a friend has a '95 Camry with the same mileage and it has also been excellent. ",Posts: 159,Member

I agree with kinley.Why isn't a comfortable ride possible without as much space? The Towncar may have more space, but it's only slightly more than the S600. I'm not sure how much the BMW has in comparison (I was using the Edmund's top10 list). Does this mean that the Towncar has the best ride of any car? No, just slightly more space. There are other factors that play into this as well such as how smooth the ride is.Also, the new Maybach 62 might be good. If they're hiring a chauffeur, they probably have the money.

I have a dilemma and I am hoping to get some advice from this forum.Now that my wife and I have had our first child I am looking for a car with 1) the most safety features (goal is to have the best chance of both surviving an accident and not suffering any major injuries) and 2) the highest reliability (for the first 5-7 years i'd like to go to the dealer to change oil and do scheduled maint. only) Yes, I know i want the sun and the moon, but this is what my research has guided me to:I am looking at two options of almost identical price ($20,000 invoice plus tax, license and fees). this is within my budget.1-Passat GL 5 manual with all front and side airbags for driver and passenger, curtain airbags, ABS, traction control and Electronic stability and 4-year warranty2-Camry SE 5 manual with all airbags, ABS (NO antiskid or Electronic stability available) premium package with leather, and fog lights and 3-year warranty.crash tests from NHTSA are similar for both vehicles:Passat: 5 stars frontal crash driver, 5 stars frontal crash passenger, 4 stars side crash front, 4 stars side crash rearCamry: 5 stars frontal driver, 4 stars frontal passenger, 3 stars side crash front, 5 stars side crash rearFrom Highway safety institutePassat: GOOD (highest rating) in all except average in restraint/dummy movementCamry: GOOD (highest rating) in all except average in foot/leg injury right front seat.I love the passat but i really do not want to deal with maint. problems (I have only owned japanese cars: a Subaru GL10 '85, a mazda protege '98 and a rav4 '99-all extremely reliable). On the other hand, I wonder if it's not worth dealing with some limited (apparently) maint. hassles to get the most safety features. Do antiskid and electr. stability really add significant value to the safety package?I know i cannot go wrong with either choice but I would still value your opinions so as not to leave it to the flip of a coin.thank youoptimist2 ",Posts: 15,Member

I've driven pickups for my personal vehicle for the last 25 years. I'm in need of a comfortable car and my priority is regular fuel only, seat comfort and ride quality. I use to do 6-700 miles a day and not even feel it, now 250 just kills my back and legs. What are some of the best choices in the 20-30k range and then the 30-35k range? My thinking is a Crown Vic Sport with Recaro or Sparco seats would be ideal, but what other cars might have that ride quality and seat support quality that I should start a short list? Toyota Avalon or Camry, Nissan Maxima? Thanks for any help. ",Posts: 423,Member

Here is a situation where you have the advantage in knowing the seller. How would you describe him? IMO you are not only buying a Camry, but in essence you are buying your uncle's integrity as well. The positive side: The relationship is one where he has always been trustworthy, i.e. Eagle Scout type of man. He would feel sad and bad if the Camry blew up on you soon after buying it. Because he is a ""good man"" he wouldn't take advantage of you.If he is the ""funny uncle"" where honesty and success is not included in his person. Take a real good look at the car.

I think after all the research I have done it is now down to the Nissan Altima 3.5 AT or the Honda EX V-6 AT. with leather, ABS and traction control. The lowest cost would help in deciding but I love the way the Altima drives but should I be more concerned with the reliability of the Honda? And resale value? what else? What should I expect to pay for either of these cars? I need to decide in the next two days or so. All input is welcome.

I am looking for opinions. I have narrowed my search to a 2003 New Mazda 6s (0% financing cost) or a 2001 Acura CLS with 21,600 miles (3.9%). Pricewise they are the same. I have test driven them both and am pleased with performance - the Mazda is a sedan, yet smaller, and brand new, which I like. The Acura has the reliability on its side (or so I've been told - no one seems to know much about Mazda reliability) and despite the age and mileage, it's depreciation is not that bad.

The M6 - WAY more fun to drive and new and it looks great IMO. Check the MPV, Protege, Miata and Mazda6 boards at Edmunds for reliability - everyone LOVES their Mazdas!

I would like any opinions offered on the used car buying choices I have. I am trying to decide between getting a 2000 Honda V6 Ex Accord (Coupe) 4-speed auto with 23000 on it for $15500, or Volkswagon Passat 2002 1.8T GLS 5- speed manual with 16581 on it for $16500, or a 2003 Subaru Legacy Special Addition Package 5-speed manual with 9600 miles for $15900??I know these may be strange cars to compare, but this is what I am looking at. I like the Passat for it's individuality and somewhat sportiness, I like the Accord for it's reliability and looks, and I like the Subie for the fact that I don't see one every mile on the roads where I live. All wheel drive could come in handy where I live, but I would not want to sacrifice too much gas mileage to have it.I am concerned about the reliability of both the VW and the Subie. I have heard that VW's are great cars, but they do not come close to the reliability of Japanese makers and I don't like having to use premium fuel. Subie's I know nothing about. Are their interiors quiet? Do they have good gas mileage? IS THEIR RELIABILITY GREAT, GOOD, FAIR, OR BAD? I have owned and enjoyed Honda's in the past, but in a way I would like to have something different. I think I am most interested in the Subie Legacy, but Edmunds gave this cars engine a ranking of 4 out of 10 and it's trans. a ranking of 6 out of ten!! I wish I knew why and if there is reason for concern. Any general or specific comments on these makes or particular models would be appreciated.P.S. I guess if I wanted to I could get a brand new Civic Ex for the amount I am looking to spend?Any ideas?P.S.S. OH, AND PLEASE COMMENT ABOUT RESALE VALUE FOR THESE MODELS IF YOU CAN.Thanks!!

Of your three choices, I would recommend the Passat. My wife and I own a 2000 Passat (V6/5speed) and it has been the best car either of us has ever owned. We've heard tales of reliability problems, but ours has been virtually trouble free for 4 years and over 40,000 miles. The ride, handling, comfort, fuel economy and features are superior to most other cars in this price range. The ride is very quiet too. And, as has often been reported, the quality of the interior is outstanding - and isn't that where you spend all of your time in a car! My previous car was a 1995 Legacy wagon, and I'll tell you there is no comparison between the two cars. The interior of my Legacy was very, very LOUD due to the course nature of the flat 4 at highway speeds. The Passat is simply a much more refined car in almost every way. Also, my Subaru blew a 5speed manual transmission at 96k which was very disappointing (and expensive). They're not as bullet-proof as legend makes them out to be. I know the new Legacys are a big improvement over the 1995 model, but you will be much happier with the 1.8t engine and overall feel provided by the Passat. Also, if you must have a Subaru I really recommend the Outback suspension over the base Legacy -- the ride is much better.The Accord is always a safe choice, but think twice about a coupe over a 4 door. I'm driving a 2 door VW GTI right now, and the only thing I miss is the 4 doors. Also, my brother in law drives an Accord sedan of that vintage and I have been very disappointed with the interior after owning VWs -- not nearly at the same level.Hope this helps your with your choice. I would go for the Passat, it sounds like a good buy. They have 4yr / 50k warranties now and if you start having real troubles you could trade it before the warranty is up. But I don't think you'll have much trouble with it based on our experience, and the positive experiences of three other close friends of ours who have also bought Passats (some after spending time in ours!).

I work for a State government, and have the “opportunity” to drive a variety of basic, American sedans that are part of our fleet on a regular basis. It seems like every year there is a new low bidder, and our State buys some different model cars. I thought I would provide my impressions and ratings of the models I drive most often to help anyone looking for a good, inexpensive American sedan to choose more wisely. I’m sure any of these cars can be found on used car lots anywhere for decent prices. I’ll start with the worst, and end with the best:5th Place – Chevy Corsica: The McCarI can’t think of anything to recommend the Corsica. It looks and feels cheap. The suspension is very rudimentary, and does not provide a secure feeling when travelling at highway speeds, and is all over the place if you hit bumps in the road, especially on curves. The engine is o.k. (4cyl), but is hampered by a lethargic 3 speed auto. It will provide good basic transportation, but you could do better and you owe it to yourself. Not recommended.4th Place – Dodge/Plymouth Neon: A buzzy little carThe Neon does handle much better than the Corsica, it has better steering, cornering and a more secure road feel. But it is quite a bit smaller, leading to a choppier ride. The engine is peppy, but it is also mated to a 3 speed auto which leads to a very loud highway ride. It sounds like that sucker is spinning at 3500-4000 rpm at 65 miles per hour, which does wear you down after a while on the road. The car is very low, and is not easy to get into and out of. The radio is pretty good, and the interior is well designed. I can’t recommend it with the automatic, but the 5 speed might be o.k. if you are looking for a smaller car.3rd Place – Ford Contour: An innocuous car with a befuddling interiorThe Contour has a much more refined ride and handling than the Corsica, and is bigger and quieter than the Neon. However, it handles like a much heavier and larger car than it actually is, which might be good for some people but feels too remote and lethargic to me. And the interior is one of the strangest design exercises in ergonomics that I’ve seen. The seats are not comfortable, and the driving position is too high compared to the rest of the interior. The console is very deep and provides lots of storage, but you have to lean down and virtually reach under the dash to pick up anything. Not a great idea when driving. The arm rest is useless, as it is mounted too high and is way too short to actually rest your elbow on while driving. And the radio is the worst of the whole bunch – it sounds terrible. Cautiously recommended if you like the look and the price, but spend some time in the interior before you buy.2nd Place – Ford Taurus (2000 and newer): A good big domestic carI’ve spend the most time in the Taurus. In a previous job I had two assigned to me, a 2000 sedan that I drove about 14,000 miles and a 2002 wagon that I drove 6,000 miles. I also drive these on my new job too, getting a different one each time. This is by far the largest of the cars, and arguably the most comfortable ride. It is also the only one with a 6cyl engine which has good power and is very quiet compared to the 4cyl engines in the other cars. The car handles confidently, as might be expected from a larger and heavier car. To my taste the ride is a bit too remote and “fluffy” but if you are looking for a smooth riding car in the American tradition this is it. Even when new, the Taurus is a good value – look especially at the wagon if you need the room. One quirk I’ve found with all of them is the transmission – it tends to have a hard time picking the right gear when passing and merging, and can be easily confused with abrupt throttle movements. At times it will “freewheel” before selecting the right gear. At first I thought it was just a problem with the 2000 sedan, but every other Taurus I’ve driven since shares this characteristic to some extent. Other than the transmission concern, I recommend the Taurus.1st Place – Chrysler Cirrus / Plymouth Breeze: A good all around packageThis car has been a real surprise to me, but I have to admit that I prefer driving these to any of the others mentioned. The car has a very roomy interior, which is well designed and quite comfortable. The seats are the best of the bunch. The engine, although it is only a 4cyl, has plenty of power and is very smooth even at higher revs. The transmission does its job smoothly and always seems to pick the right gear (which is the best thing I can say about an automatic, since I’m a die hard manual transmission fan!). The suspension provides a very good highway ride, but also manages to provide communicative steering and very secure handling. The Taurus is smoother, but if you want to feel the road the Chrysler is better. The radio is very good too. If I needed to buy a comfortable, inexpensive, fuel efficient used sedan I would probably choose one of these. Certainly recommended.I know this is long, and answers a question that no one has asked, at least not in awhile. But I’m hoping that it will generate some discussion, and help some folks choose the right sedan. Have you any experience with any of these models – what do you think? ",Posts: 37,Member

I'm trying to decide between the above models, but I've heard some things about each that are concerning:1. Does the accord really not have a split rear seat? Will this be changed with the 2004 model? 2. Does the camry really only take premium gas? Specifically, does the SE model only take premium gas?If anyone can offer answers to these, or any advice at all, that would be very much appreciated. I am a recent college grad looking for a car that will last me many many years. I currently have a Mazda 626 which is having some problems. I want something that will not only be a reasonable buy now, but will be generally low-cost throughout the life of the car. Meaning insurance shouldn't be too high, gas milage should be low, routine maintenance should be relatively inexpensive, and premium gas is not an option for me. I'm considering getting the navigational system if I get an accord, but is there a monthly fee associated with it? A GPS system seems like it would have some sort of satellite access fee, but I haven't heard of any mentioned. Also, I'm not dead-set on a 2003 model, since I haven't been seeing too many around anymore. So any comments or reviews on improvements in 2004 models would be appreciated.I've heard many good things about both models of these cars, but my decisions are affected more by consumer *complaints* than praises, since I've heard just about every glowing review these cars have. It's the repeated complaints that get my attention more.Please help! And thanks in advance for any advice! ",Posts: 1,Member

The Accord seems to be the odd ball here and kind of confuses me. Are you looking for a family sedan or not? That aside, if you are looking for the sporty ride that is big enough for 2 go with the Passat. The downside is that reliability and dealer service are far from top notch. If you want a larger car with better reliability get the Legacy. Performance isn't great, and neither is rear seat room, but it is a nice package that you don't see everyday. I haul more than two people regularly so it is difficult for me to recommend a coupe much less comment on them. Hope this helps and good luck. ",Posts: 465,Member

Pat -- I actually purchased my GTI used last October, and have driven it about 10,000 miles so far. It is a great car, and as I mentioned in my other post the only things I miss are the back two doors. The car has great performance, and the ""touring"" suspension is practical on a daily basis while allowing all of the performance you can realistically manage on public roads. Those looking for a sedan version should look at the Jetta GLI, which offers the same engine and a similar suspension. Mine is sitting in for a station wagon/SUV/pickup so the hatchback is essential.Bunk -- I'm not sure if you saw my earlier post, but I concur with porknbeans that you should get the Passat. Trust me, it will be worth the extra $1000. I will differ from porknbeans in that dealer service is not universally poor. I have had a positive experience with my dealer, and in fact we own 2 VWs now. I would not have bought the second if we had not been pleased with the first. ",Posts: 37,Member

From when I drove the Legacy I thought that the performance was OK. It got you to speed, kept up with traffic and did an overall adequate job. However, if you are looking to put a grin on your face once in awhile and make some sort of an indentation in the seat back from a stop light for giggles or need to pass somebody on a 2-laner with very little room the Legacy won't do that. The GT version is an improvement even if it has the smaller engine, but the 6 cylinder seemed to get winded. These are my opinions and I would suggest you drive them on your own to help with your decision. ",Posts: 465,Member

near-luxosimho, I think the I35 is the most bang for the buck right now, even though it doesn't have all the ""latest"" technology.

Mostly just a matter of taste. More suave luxury with the I35; more sportiness with the TL.I was thinking the other day, the I35 seems to me right now like the perfect realtor's car - style, luxury, size, reliability and value.

Well the Beetle certainly is ""well rounded""!

They can also get pretty pricey to repair.You probably should stick with a used Corolla or Civic.Best from a design and performance standpoint is Ford Focus, but you should probably stay away from the 2000 and 2001 model years, they had their growing pains. Otherwise it's a great car and reliability is now average per Consumer Reports.

I am biased because I own one, but I would recommend a Taurus equipped with the adjustable pedal option and get a model with the power driver's seat.

I don't believe any of these has 4WD (except a 2004 G35, but I want a 1-2yr used). I liked the drive of the G35 the best, but i'm worried about snow. I'd go for a used 2003 G35 if it wasn't RWD (but the dealer told me it has ""traction control"" so i'd be alright??) I think the A4 is a little overpriced, but I might be wrong?A couple of other quick questions -- What's the difference between AWD and 4WD?FWD is better than RWD for snow, right?

1. I would try and do some more research on the value of 1-2 year old car. I've found just price shopping that most used cars in the DC area are overpriced and new cars can be a better deal. But look at each deal separately, probably can't generalize too much.2. 4wd is a term used to define the old truck style drive train. You had a transfer case and front locking hubs in which case you could engage 4wd when you wanted to. AWD is a term to describe the drive train that operates all the time. In general, heavy duty pickups will have 4wd, pickups and SUVs will have 4wd or AWD (depends on manufacturer)and sedans will have AWD. In my mind the major difference between a full time 4wd and AWD is that 4wd has a 2 speed transfer case and AWD does not.3. There are tons of AWD sedans, Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Audi, Subaru, Volkswagen, Infiniti G35 is available w/AWD, Jaguar and probably some others I can' think of off hand. AWD is an option on these cars so not all of them will have it. Choices are plentiful. The drawback to AWD is maintenance and cost.4. Most people would say that FWD is better than RWD in slippery conditions, but it is really the fact that the engine sits over the drive wheels. It is the weight that is the advantage - not necessarily the drive layout. That's why old VW bugs were so good in the snow is the engine sat over the drive wheels. The other major factor is the tires. A good set of winter tires would make a RWD car more than manageable here in the DC area. Winter tires would be more effective on a FWD car and then even more effective on a AWD car. If you had room to store a winter set of tires and wheels there would be little reason not to get your choice, if you like the G35.3. Recommendations. Broaden your search a little more to those makes I've listed above if you really want AWD. You may find more choices. If I were passionate about the design of the car I would probably look at the little Jag - pretty distinctive styling, but so is the G35. If I wanted an appliance vehicle, sturdy, strong, and wouldn't crush my heart if another car slide into on those snowy trafficways, I'd look at either the Subaru Legacy or VW Passat. You could buy either one pretty well loaded and new for less than 30k.Hope this helps. ",Posts: 423,Member

If I were going to drive it 100K+ miles then I would look for something comfortable (with styling I can live with) and purchase the premium extended warranty. If there is a problem with the car I bring it to my dealer, pick up my loaner and say goodbye In the big scheme of things, what do I care what the car is worth after 100K miles? Yes, some cars will be worth more than others, but at what initial cost?2.	Assuming I take this route, I would buy a car with the best options & features for the least amount of money. Yes, I would look at a Hyundai Yes, I would look at the American cars3.	If I plan to sell the car after a few years I would stick with the classics; Honda, Toyota, etc.Since I have always purchased cars for the long haul, I have always purchased the extended warranty and it paid for itself (except for a 1996 Saturn which I sold at 75K never bought the warranty and never had a problem). In the next 6mo to 1yr I will buy my wife a Honda minivan and yes, I will purchase the extended warranty. Maybe it is overkill, but the $1500.00 is well worth the 10yr/100K insurance policy and knowledge she always has a vehicle to drive.Keep in mind this opinion does not account for vehicle performance. That is something you need to put a price on.Good Luck ",Posts: 8,Member

A simple answer...the Mazda 3Price point is there, between 17.5K and 22K. THE INTERIOR IS AMAZING!!!THE HANDLING AND POWER OF THE CAR IS AMAZING!!This is not your boring Corolla or Civic, this is a real drivers car with adequate space for 4 and a reasonable size trunk, slightly larger than the predecessor Protege.I test drove it about two weeks ago and am considering purchasing one. I can't find a better value in the economy car segment!!Conclusion: Mazda 3. ",Posts: 38,Member

Need another testimonial on the Mazda 3? It's a great litle car, got mine in November with GT_GFX package and have been smiling ever since. Your price range is bang on, and as weaponous said, you'll be happily surprised. Nothing bad about the Civic or Acura EL by the way (good selections too you know...), but the 3 is more modern inside and out. The only minor gripe we early Mazda 3 owners have, is that the Mazda 3 does not offer traction control - but keep in mind most economy cars dont either, but it may be available on some. The Jetta I believe has it available, but is less reliable and quite a bit more expensive. Most people dont need traction control but it may be something you want to consider in your decision before you buy. Mazda 3 is rated ""Best Buy"" in class by AJAC (Automotive Journalist Association of Canada) and also by ""Guide de l'auto"" (Quebec Car Guide)Pet ",Posts: 153,Member

You are correct, your bias is showing through. However, if you are willing/able to wait until later this year (I think) Ford will be coming out with what looks to be a decent competitor to the camcord stronghold. It is called the Five-hundred and you can see pictures of it linked from Edmunds home page. My opinion is that right now there isn't a real good ""domestic"" competitor.

I need to find a ""Mid Size"" sedan for my Mom that has a Split Bench Front Seat. A full size car is just to big for her. She has a 1998 Buick Century, but the 2004 Model looks almost identical. Any suggestions where I can find some sort of list of manufactures that offer this as an ""option"" ",Posts: 1,Member

January 2004 ",badgerfan,"
Ford Taurus has optional split bench with a flip fold console. When closed the center can be used for a seat but I wouldn't put anyone there for any extended period of time, as all three front passengers would be very uncomfortable. With this option, you get a column mounted shifter. The ""backrest"" portion of the center area folds down, whether or not the seat cushion part is flipped open or not, and makes for a nice wide comfy right arm rest.I have this in my Taurus and find the flip fold feature to be very useful. When it is opened up, since you do not have a floor shifter, there is more room in the console to place the cup holders further forward, making them easier to reach than floor mounted shifter versions.She will find Taurus to be a bit stiffer ride than her old Century but no excessively so, with tighter handling than her Century. The car is built like a brick, solid and without gimmicks. Some will say it is rental car bland, but I could care less, it is a well built good looking car and a screaming bargain, whether you buy a base model or loaded up. ","Posts: 1,565",Member

In that price range and guessing that your mom is probably in the 50-60 year old bracket, I would suggest a Buick Century or LeSabre. You may also want to check out the Ford Crown Vic/Mercury Grand Marquis or the Lincoln Town Car. It isn't that I'm pushing the ""American Iron"" button here, I just think that you can get a lot of car for the money with the kind of ride that she may enjoy (based on the fact my parents are in the same age bracket).

Okay guys, I'm looking for advice.My mother-in-law needs a new set of wheels.Basic parameters are:1) Must be an ""American Made"" product.2) 4 door sedan3) Budget is probably <$25K4) No ""Snowbirding""She's in her 70's, doesn't have good night vision, and is living in Florida, so no need for 4WD, etc. The reason for #1 is family politics, pure and simple.The reasons for #2 is that she will want to be able to occasionally transport her grandkids, and while I agree that a Dodge minivan is a theoretical possibility, its probably a very long shot.For #3 (budget), my Father-in-Law was in a nursing home, but is in the hospital, so their total household savings is under quite a drain, and won't get any better. If there's a choice in the 25-30K range, its not completely out of question, but the benefits must be huge to justify it. This means that stuff like leather interior are a non-starter.And #4 means that there's no need to load up the trunk 1x/year to drive cross-country. Her luggage needs are close to zero, and a ""long distance drive"" is ~1 hour drive up to my wife's sister's house.Thanks...I'm very interested to see what the suggestions are!-hh ",Posts: 356,Member

My opinion is that there are 2 very easy choices and then several others to consider. The first would be the Buick Century. In my part of the country, new ones are going in the $18k range and what seasoned citizen wouldn't rather have a Buick? The second would be the Ford Taurus. New ones around here are going for $14-15k and one year old models are $9-10k. I think that both are wonderfully average cars that your mother-in-law would like and they are well below the financial requirement (something you may want to weigh very heavily if the hospital payments don't have any signs of improving). You might also want to consider a Chevy Malibu, Dodge Stratus or Olds Alero. Good luck and let us know what you choose. ",Posts: 465,Member

All of those cars have enough miles that they could, if previously thrashed, leave you a pedestrian. The 96 Corolla was a sturdy car but the motors do sludge up if the oil isnt changed regularly. That and other issues should be something a private mechanic could spot if you took it in for a pre-purchase check up. There are sites on here where the pros congregate.

. . .if you have beaten me up before on this issue, I ask that you not beat me up again, I know the drill, I respect your opinion and, I actually do agree with some of it.The question you may have to ask yourself is to weigh reliability and drivability/performance.I want my Audis to be more reliable. I wish they were. Frankly they have not been bad as far as I'm concerned in this regard.Audis therefore, may be less reliable -- I care not, here and now, to debate this -- there's plenty of cyber ink devoted to this subject already.And, I have not driven either of the 2005 cars you are considering.I have, however, owned nearly 30 Audis, 2 VW's, 1 BMW and a handful of Chrysler products from the 1970's era.Nothing, so far, (and I do test drive others and even rent others just to make certain I am mostly sane) comes close to the driving experience I have had with my German cars.So, while I may consider the Acura, the Chrysler 300C and the Cadillac STS, the performance issues will, for me, outweigh reliability issues every time.It seems, and I can sense the backlash comin' already, that high performance and high reliability remain simultaneously elusive goals.That's my OPINION and I'm stickin' to it.As you were.

Audi had better do something about their quality issues before I would even think of buying one. The current A6 is one of the worst cars they've ever made, 3 recalls to fix the same ignition coil problem, faulty brake rotors, eletrical problems, bumpers that rip off, the list goes on. The A6 also ranks in at 6th place on the Pennsylvania lemon law site for most cases for '03, and way up there in NHTSA complaints. Also, Audi's have terrible residual, most likely do to their quality problems. Here in the states, a '00 Audi A6 goes for $20K, about 1\3 of its origial tag.

. . .on the reliability issue, I hope I get at least a pass on being a pro-am owner, what with almost 30 [Germans] of them (bewteen my wife and me) since 1977.Perhaps lexusguy is right -- and I assume he has had at least 10 Audis personally to make such claims.My 2003 Audi allroad 2.7T (with every possible option except auto trans) has 29K miles on it and, other than tires, has been 99% trouble and hassle free. Full disclosure: the previous 2000 and 2001 A6 4.2's had brake rotor issues aplenty -- but all covered under Audi Advantage, so not too much of an issue for me.My wife has had 3 Audi TT's -- 0 problems with them other than short tire life.Conversely, my BMW (my only 1) a 1988 325ix was constantly in the shop for ""maintenance"" not that too many things broke. But, every trip to the dealer for routine stuff was always $300.More full disclosure -- I have not ever owned any Japanese car. All my friends that do own them, however, generally speak highly of their reliability. None of my friends with such cars, Acuras included, speak highly of the cars ""drivability and performance.""Reading here and knowing a few folks who own American, European and Japanese cars -- it appears that the European owners speak of their cars' performance and drivability, American owners speak of their cars' affordability and Japanese owners speak of their cars' reliability.The folks I know have Acuras, Audis, BMWs, Cadillacs, Chevies, Chryslers, Hondas,Oldsmobiles Saabs, Toyotas, Volkwagens and Volvos. This cross section of car owners coupled with my own experience is hardly scientific -- but those BMW guys, for sure, wouldn't dream of buying a Lexus -- even though they claim to have test driven them.To each his own.If my current Audi represents the ""trouble"" these things are to own, I say ""keep it up, Audi!""However, please note, I also said I do want my cars to be ever more reliable -- as long as that is not at the expense the the ""driving pleasure"" -- far-fig-newton [sic] indeed!

If I ever bought a car that had major mechanical problems before 30K miles I would be REALLY upset. Is 30K some kind of accomplishment? My '96 LS had 150 thousand miles on it when I traded, not one problem. When your Audi hits 150, let me know how spotless its maintanence record is. Why would I have to own 10 Audi's to state public facts? Those arent something I made up because I dont like Audi.""More than 530,000 Audis & Volkswagens, years 2001-2003, have problems with their ignition coils. Many of these drivers could be entitled to a new car or full or partial refund under the Pennsylvania Lemon Law, New Jersey Lemon Law, or Federal Warranty Laws."" Audi A6: 7,874 Pennsylvania lemon law claims for the '03 model year, when most of the A6 problems were supposed to be FIXED. The A6 is also listed as a ""repeat offender"" on CR's list of worst used cars.I think the GS looks great in person, but its the kind of thing you have to see for yourself. You may also want to consider an '06 Infinti M35\45. Unless Lexus decides to dramatically change the driving experience of the GS, my guess is that the next M and the RL will be the more exciting to fling around some corners, though the '04 LS430 with the sport suspension and 18"" wheels is A LOT more fun than the old car, so perhaps Lexus is getting away a bit from their ""silent cloud"" style.

. . .was and remains that strong opinions are often formed based on personal experiences. If one simply looks at recalls of cars -- from all parts of the planet -- over a period of years, I would suspect it would be possible to use these statistics to support a variety of conclusions.It is fine and OK with me that some folks measure their likes and dislikes based on reliability -- or other characteristics.My wife and I have had almost 30 Audi cars -- and, in the spirit of full disclosure -- I don't recall EVER keeping one of them beyond 50,000 miles.I have also been known to say that keeping one of these cars without a warranty can be ""breathtakingly expensive.""But, I assume an Acura, Infinity, Lexus or Cadillac is also expensive to ""fix"" without a warranty, too. And, I do NOT think 30K virtually trouble free miles is a new world's record of any kind. However, I do want to be one non-bashing German car (especially Audi and VW) voice. Some folks rail on about the coil problems, or the turbo problems or whatever they have had or read about -- and I do not doubt the veracity of their messages (especially if they have owned many of the marquis that they are railing about).I am certain that Lexus, or Acura or Infitiny or whatever your fave is, has many fine qualities. Speaking only as an ""army of one"" I am far more interested in the driving experience than the repair experience.I suspect this would change, if the repair experience became so onerous that it smothered the rest of the attributes of a given car/brand.In my experience, even the most acute lack of reliability that I have personally experienced with my German cars, is -- at most -- aggravating. The joy of driving them, however, always trumps the few problems I have experienced.Maybe had I personally had a coil problem my ire would surface. As it stands, I can only give a strong positive recommendation to people who ask me about my Audis.I also say, European cars generally and German cars more specifically and Audis more specifically still are not for everybody.The two people I work with who own Acuras -- for example -- love them, but, as noted they love them because they essentially put gas in them and drive. One of these cars does have over 100,000 miles on it -- it seems in good shape, too. I personally would not find the car satisfying drive -- it isn't even great to ride in. But that is because I value different attributes.Thus far it would appear that nothing comes close to the Japanese when it comes to reliability and ditto for the Germans where it comes to the driving pleasure.Now, the times they are a-changin' -- the Americans seem to be sneaking up on the fun to drive factor and the Europeans do, by some accounts, seem to be slipping in the ""perceived quality factor"" all the while the Japanes continue to build the ""we are bullet proof"" reputation.I will be ""in the market"" in the next 12 months -- my interest, thus far, is in evaluating the new Acura RL, Chrylser 300C/AWD, Cadillac STS/AWD and Audi A6 and S4. The price range would appear to be $45K to 55K equipped as I would probably buy.This is the first time I can remember in years, when I feel there are some ""real interesting"" choices for me -- given my ""bias"" for that German car feel (the Ultimate Driving Machine, as one German calls themselves). I particularly am keen to drive the new STS, for example.I am certain no one's mind is changed -- but at the risk of ticking someone off, I have, previously felt that the Japanese cars were ""perfect"" in every way -- except in the ""driving experience"" category. I don't doubt, however, their reliability.The 2005 Acura may be an epiphany. And the 2005 Audi may be a dud, for all I know.I'll make my choice, however, not based on statistics. I say choose your cars like you choose your spouse -- hmmm, maybe I shoulda evaluated her statistically, instead.Just kidding dear, if you're reading this. . . ","Posts: 5,343",Member

I can understand where you are coming from. While I've never owned any Audi's myself, I have owned used M-Bs and BMWs in my early days, which is I think where a lot of my bias against German cars comes from, especially my experience owning a used 7 series. If someone were interested in buying new, and selling in a few years, by all means. Nobody can match German (well, most Benzes and some BMW) residual, and coupled with M-B's free maintanence under warranty, leasing say a '04 CLK500 could be less expensive to own than even Lexus or Acura. However, I tend to keep my cars long after the warranty has run out, and this is where I tend to shy away from recommending a German vehicle to someone who wants something for say, the next 10 years.The 300C and STS don't do much of anything for me, Chrysler for their unrefined engines, I dont want a big block pick up engine in my car, and unproven quality on their new models, which almost always means residual drops like a stone. Second hand Pacificas are CHEAP. As for the STS, I dont have a particular problem with the Northstar V8, but the styling looks like a supersized CTS, and from what I saw at the NY auto show, Cadillac still cant get interior materials quality or fit and finish even close to the level of Germany or Japan. I also smell $5,000 cash back incentives and terrible residual on that car as well. True they are getting better, but considering how bad their cars were just a few years ago, thats not saying all that much ","Posts: 6,419",Member

Unfortunately its hard to tell with that kind of thing, regardless of the manufacturer, the model usually has to be on the market for at least two years or so before any kind of reliability index can be made, as they come from owner surveys, and people have to have a chance to actually buy the car  What I can tell you is that the outgoing generation A6 seems to be Audi's worst offender. Their other cars havent been particular stand outs as being plagued with issues, but at the same time, they arent rated particularly well either. Basically if you want something thats pretty much gauranteed to be trouble free and can last 300K+ miles, Toyota, Honda, and to a somewhat lesser extent (though Infiniti's are rated very highly for reliability) Nissan is where you want to be. That said, if you're looking for some real driving excitement, Toyota may not be the best choice. Acura made a great start with the original Legend, but then lost their way in the 90s with the soft and pudgy RL, and the Vigor and early CL\TL. They seem to be regaining their performance roots though, the RSX Type-S, TSX (Accord Euro R) and the new TL have all gotten great reviews as far as fun factor is concerned, and hopefully the new RL will continue that. Infiniti is kind of all over the map, as they are still in the midst of a Renault fueled rescue. The G35 (Nissan Skyline) is a fantastic driving machine, easily a solid 3 series competitor. So if you want a decent mix of performance and reliability, a G35, TL, or RL could be what you are looking for. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

pg48477 is pretty much right on the money, at least about the outgoing car. The 3.0 inline is a great engine, but the GS is just too heavy for it, and its slow as a result. The GS430 is fast enough to keep up with a 540i and an E500 on the highway, but the platform dates back to '97, when Lexus wasnt particularly interested in driving excitement. That seems to be changing, and based on poor GS430 sales, combined with the new sport suspension and 18"" wheels now available on the LS (things its never had before) my guess is that they may tighten up the new GS to make it more competitive. Its still a big question mark though, so your just gonna have to get behind the wheel of the new car when its released and try it out. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

Well, that would make it go from awful to merely poor. Europeans have slipped to 3rd place world wide behind US and Japanese nameplates, with an average of 20% of cars having major issues, versus 10% for Japan. If you buy a new Audi, anything that crops up should be covered under the warranty. I would definitely caution against a used out of warranty car with more than 60K miles though. If you plan to hold on to it for 3 or 4 years and trade it would be ok.. but I wouldnt expect to get much money back. Audi doesnt have Mercedes resale. You could buy a new say E500, drive it 3 years, and sell it for 80% of what you paid. For a three year old Audi, you'd be lucky to get 50%. Lexus and Acura will also return more than Audi.

Good question. The RL is kind of a wild card, but based on the TSX and TL, my guess is it will be a BMW style car, quick, agile, and fast. The GS will be more of an E class type car, superb long distance cruiser, quick and comfortable, but not something you'd necessarily want to fling into a corner at 90mph. The new Infinti M should be closer to the RL side of the spectrum, and its 4.5L V8, if they can get the gearing right this time, will be faster than both of them. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

I'm going to have to disagree as well. If people dont take care of their cars, then they are going to fall apart, plain and simple. A Mercedes owner who never cleans or treats the leather, never polishes or waxes the car, and never does any kind of preventative maintanence, the car is gonna fall to pieces, German or not. The difference between Germany and Japan is that with a German car, once you get past the 150K point, just keeping the engine running means literally pouring money into the car, and constant trips to the shop. Japanese cars arent like that. My own '96 LS400 had 156K miles on it when I traded, I went to the dealer for regular scheduled maintanence and generally took very good care of the car, not a single problem. I've also had a chance to talk to the techs at my Lexus dealer on occasion, and they said that they get LS400s and ES250s with 300K+ all the time. A friend of mine had a Mercedes SL from the mid '80s, it was literally a nightmare, he dumped it after less than a year.Boomsama, you have to remember that Mercedes has been selling cars in North America since the '50s, and the company is over 100 years old. Lexus, Acura, and Infinti are only about 15 years old, and the entire Japanese auto industry has only been selling cars globally for about 35 years. In the '30s, Toyota was making textiles.

Well Lexuses do hold up better than other Japanese cars and I've seen this first hand. But the way Mercedes used to make their cars they had no equal in longevity. A Mercedes could be driven to hell and back. Cars like the W126 S-Class (1981-1991), W124 E-Class (1986-1995) and the R129 SL (1990-2002) were built to last. Now I know these newer ones are not of the same ilk (for many reasons), but still. I see MY 2000 S-Classes in just as good a shape as LS400s of the same time frame. Particularly in the area of the driver's seat leather (you know that industrial grade leather MB uses does great here, but felt like..well cheap), and paint and body integrity. ""The difference between Germany and Japan is that with a German car, once you get past the 150K point, just keeping the engine running means literally pouring money into the car, and constant trips to the shop. Japanese cars aren't like that."" I disagree with this to the point of it being somewhat exaggerated. Japanese cars need belts, hoses and everything any car would need to keep the engine running with that many miles. The difference is that most Japanese car owners will usually call this ""maintenance"" because Japanese cars will run in whatever condition whereas a European car will usually give some type of warning that something is in need of attention, and if ignored a breakdown will happen..hence it being called a problem at that point. I've seen this happen so many times, especially with Mercedes, BMW, and particularly with Volvos. Saabs just tend to ""quit"" first. M ","Posts: 6,081",Member

Depends on the dealer, and exactly what was done to the car. Merc1 is right, things made of ruber, gaskets, seals, etc, will fail, regardless of what country the car came from. At 100K, my LS needed a new oil seal $900, and new rear shocks $500. Properly maintained, a Lexus will last for an extremely long time, but that proper maintainence does cost money. It's not a Corolla. As with any car you will pay more at the dealer, but I like the general peace of mind that they know exactly what they're doing, and a local shop will not come to the house and get my car, and drop off a loaner like Lexus does.

Interesting discussion. I own a Mercedes and a Lexus. The Mercedes is the ML350 and it is a great vehicle for our family. We love it.The Lexus GS300 is mine and I love it big time. It has lived up to everything I hoped it would.There are definitely differenes between the two. The leather, safety equipment and even the paint are superior in the Mercedes. we have an inspiration edition with the silver stitched perforated leather and it just exudes quality.My Lexus seems to get more stone chips on the pant and the leather is cheaper feeling. However, the overall quality and feel are much better. Far fewer rattles and quirks. I'm excited to get into my Lexus each morning.Bottom line is that there is no winner in every category, But having researched almost every near-luxury and luxury car available, The GS was my clear quality winner.

Interesting. My wife and I considered the ML320, but being a body-on-frame, we found the ride a bit too truckish for our tastes. Also, I'm very technically inclined, and it took me about five minutes to figure out how to change the radio station on the ""Command"" system. Apparently you hit the ""9"" key, and then type in the freq, or something to that effect if memory serves. Since it was going to be for my wife, there was no way she was ever going to figure it out, she's not a manual reader. Also at that time, Mercedes was still using CD based NAV systems, and that was pretty much the deal breaker right there.I do agree that German cars have their strengths, the biggest one being their residual value, which, for at least M-B and BMW, are some of the industry's highest. It is nice to know that if you buy a new CLK500, 3 years down the line the car will still be worth like 80% of its new tag, which makes leasing a very attractive idea. I would actually consider a CLK500 for my new drop top to replace my XKR if I didnt dislike Command so much. They also clean up on the fun to drive factor. The M3 SMG is an absolute blast.

Lexus interior quality is MUCH higher than Toyota, which is already pretty much at the top of the mainstream segment. Take a look at the ES330, its essentially a Camry XLE V6 under there, but the interior is better than anything you can get for under $50,000. Lexus cars get better seats (though dont expect huge side bolsters) Higher quality leather, real wood trim, and the best fit and finish in the entire auto industry.

Mark:I agree with you completely. Over the last 7 years my wife and I have owned: 1993 Toyota Camry, 1998 ES 300, 1999 Ford Explorer, 2001 Audi A6 2.7 T, 2001 Honda Accord; 2002 Acura MDX and, my recent purchase, a 2001 Audi A4 1.8 T. After owning these cars, there is absolutely no question in my mind that Lexus/Toyota makes the most reliable cars out there. Period. The worst made cars- Audi. No question. I purchased my 2001 Audi A4 as a CPO car in December and it has been to the shop 4 times- trip computer not working, 2 check engine lights, clutch replacement. Fortunately, all were replaced on Audi's dime as it was a CPO car. They balked at replacing the clutch, trying to tell me, in pleasant words, that my driving caused the clutch to give out in 3 months. However, I found out they had no documentation on the condition of the clutch during their ""300 point"" inspection, so they replaced it. As insane as it sounds, our favorite car of the bunch is the A4. There is simply not a better driving car out there. Yes, I am still considering a new Audi for my next vehicle. I just don't find a better mix of interior comfort, looks and driving than this car. My caution is to buy new or CPO. If it is CPO, make sure it is from a reputable dealer. I can't say I would recommend the new A6. My 2001 A6 2.7T was fast and had a beautiful interior, but the driving was ""floaty"" and the steering imprecise. I would like more room than the A4 but the driving characteristics of the current A6, along with the poor reliability, would keep me at arms length unless the 2005 changes drastically.Honestly, on every trip to the shop I told my wife ""I should have bought a Lexus"". However, every time I'm in the market, I just can't find a model that suites me. I almost bought a GS 400 a few years back, but I personally think it was one of the worst rear wheel drive cars I have ever driven in regards to steering and control. I remember hitting an on ramp fairly hard and almost losing control. I will look at the new GS but it is unlikely to change very much. Two different philosophies. ",Posts: 105,Member

The A4 is a great drivers car indeed. However, I would argue that a 3 series beats it at everything, and is more reliable as well. The 330ix takes care of the quattro issue. I've driven the A4 3.0, and its nice, but there's just no power there. With the automatic and 220hp, it needs about 8 seconds to make it to 60mph, which is the bottom of the class. Even the ES330 can beat it now. The 3 series with the same 220hp can pull 6 second 0-60 sprints, and compete with the likes of the 265hp Maxima and 270hp TL. I agree that the previous GS certainly was not the sportiest car in the world. However, that doesnt mean all of Japan is like that. Want an engaging drive AND reliability? Try a new G35 sedan. It will beat an A4 at every performance catergory, and Infinti's reliability is up there with Lexus as gold standard. The G also has some serious torque, and when you mash the go pedal, it hunkers down and you get an almost V8 like rush. The A4 3.0 kind of wheezes out of first gear, and the engine is working really hard to lug all that weight around. Another great car is the new for '04 TL. Acura took a ""nice for its price"" near lux and turned it in to a real sport sedan. With the 6-speed manual and the A-spec package, it will beat everybody else in the segment. The A4 wouldnt even stand a chance. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

Funny, I made a post last night about the leather on Lexus and Mercedes, and it didn't register. I'll try again.As for the Lexus line-up, even the LS430 has leather seating trim, not full leather. This info is available on the Lexus site under:http://www.lexus.com/models/ls/specifications.htmlMercedes does have the full leather option on the E320, but it costs an extra $1500 over the leather seating inserts. Personally this is a fair amount of money IMO for something you probably won't really notice, but I understand why someone might care about this or want it.I think saying one car is better than another is kind of silly, because in this price range, you are going to get a quality product.ACURA: best deal for the money, but some cheapness on the interior, and some recent concerns about transmissions.MERCEDES: Total quality product with the best safety features. Some general reliability problems according to Consumer Reports and JD Power.LEXUS: More money for a little less product than Acura, but highest build quality and reliability. Probably not as exciting to drive as Acura or Mercedes. Most Lexus buyers know this and don't mind because they prefer the other benefits.Finally, I would also say the E-Class is the most beautifully-styled of any car in this class.

""The mid $20s TSX absolutely embarrases the C320 in terms of interior materials.""I don't know about that. First of all, the simulated wood in the TSX really does look fake. I mean really fake. Second, the leather is pretty cheap. Don't get me wrong, I don't think the C-class interior is all that nice either, but I wouldn't exactly say the TSX ""absolutely embarrases"" the C320 interior.

I think it's pretty hard to talk about leather quality on new cars, like the new TL. I sat in this vehicle only 4 months ago and tested it for over an hour. Many, many, many plusses with this car. But the leather was only OK. Looked nice and smelled ice, but not high quality. You know they have to skimp on some things, because they have so many other awesome things in the vehicle (engine, sound system, safety etc). You need to compare older vehicles leather to get an idea of quality, and you need to know if the owner took good care of the leather.I saw a 2001 Jaguar type-S in a local dealer, and the leather was aweful. Cracks everywhere and all faded. Terrible!!! I have seen older Mercs that are from the early 90s, that have great looking leather. The Acura TL has leather inserts, and the wood is fake...and loks cheap. But as mentioned there are things in this car that put my GS to shame, like the sound-system and price.You need to condition your leather and take careof the interior frequently if you want the car to look good long-term. But most people aren't like me, as I like to keep my cars for 10+ years. My last car was a 1995 civic which I lovedFred ",Posts: 21,Member

I think you'll like the GS. I really like the current car, and its 7 years old at this point. The new car could be lowered, or it could be larger wheels giving it the appearance of a lower stance, the max on the previous car where 17s. Based on the change in attitude of the '04 LS, my guess is that the new GS is going to take a significant step foward in driving dynamics, while retaining the traditional Lexus feel. I like tearing up some back roads as much as the next guy, but I spend about 98% of my time behind the wheel either in stop and go traffic, or on the highway, as most people probably do, and there's really no better car than a Lexus for that kind of work. It soaks up the potholes, manhole covers, and other crap that PA drivers have to deal with, keeps most noise out of the car, and the Mark Lev sound system will make you want to buy a $10,000 hifi so you can get that kind of sound at home.Maxhonda, when I refered to the C320, I was mostly refering to that awful center console, and HVAC controls.

My guess is that the GS350GT will be based on a new as yet unreleased 3.5L V6 from Toyota. The 350GT will supposedly have 300hp from its gas engine, and 300hp from 3.0L is something that nobody has been able to pull off at this point (except maybe the previous Euro spec M3?), so it would be a REALLY impressive engine if it was the 3.0L. Most likely it will be a 3.5, combined with a supposed 170hp electric, which if Toyota can actually pull off, they could basically own the planet, as they could be making 200-250hp cars that sip gasoline like a moped.Personally I have two cars, an '01 LS430 that I drive to work every day, and an '00 XKR for weekends and such, though Im going to get rid of the Jag pretty soon.

Um, thats completely wrong. The RX400h uses the electric to drive the rear wheels, and the gasoline engine for the front wheels. They can both work at the same time. Since the 40hp electric in the 400h isnt enough to do much for that car, it does most of its work in slow city traffic, when not much power is needed, but like in the Prius, both engines are capable of working at the same time.

Yes, I would say that 0-60 matters more than any other car performance statistic to most people. Skid pad numbers, 60-0 braking times, lane change manuvers, etc. all take a back seat to 0-60. Infiniti engines suffer from poor transmition programming and tall gearing, not necessarily ""overrated"" power. How much bigger is a G35 than a 3 series? If Infiniti can get their autobox right this time, 280hp in the M35 should have some serious performance. How much faster is the FX45 than every german SUV except the Cayenne turbo?

Both engines are capable of working at the same time, but you will not get the same performance as you would from one gasoline engine with the same HP and Torques as hybrid. Plus you probably will get the same performance for RX330 with 3.3L as you would from RX400H(which has the same 3.3L plus electric motor).

Not exactly. The Prius is designed for extreme fuel economy, so yes, a regular gas engine with the same hp and torque as the combined engines in the prius would be faster. However, toyota is designing the 400h with performance in mind, and the extra fuel economy as an added bonus. They know that someone who is spending $45K+ isnt going to mind the $1.70 or whatever for 89 octane. Electric motors make 100% of their torque immediately, and so they can fill in the gap while the V6 winds up to its optimum powerband. The 400h is expected to be significantly quicker than the RX330. Thats why they're calling it the 400h, its supposed to have similar performance as if their old 4.0L was in the engine bay. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

I think its going to be more than a few tenths. Nissan is going to want under 6.5, if they want to be competitive, and that beats the 530i by a large margin. IF Nissan uses a proper six-speed auto, thats fast and has a short first gear, 280hp could = a really fast car. Just as an example, my XKR has 370hp, and all that muscle is entirely brought down by a sluggish 5-speed slush box with a 1st gear thats too tall. If you floor a 350hp Vette, you can light up the rear tires and then pull 4.5-5 second 0-60s.

lexusguy,All I'm saying is look at the acceleration difference between a 330i and G35. Despite the horsepower difference between the 2, the 330i is only a few tenths of a second slower. And again, the weight difference between the 2 is negligible. You're right the M35 could be a fast car(faster car than the 530i), but looking at Nissan's track record, I doubt it it will be considerably faster. Look at the Q45 vs. LS430. The Q45 has a supposed 50bhp advantage yet is about the same in acceleration. Personally I think their engines are overrated in terms of power. Even magazines have said Nissan seems to overrate power.

The Solara is all new for '04. Theres' a raging debate about EX V6 coupe vs. Solara, but if you want the drop top, that answers that question. Dont bother with the Chrysler, the Sebring is a Dinosaur compared to the new Honda and Toyota. The Altima's interior has been redesigned, and looks MUCH better. The first ever Altima SE-R went on sale this year also, so if you're looking for a seriously quick alternative to Camry or Accord...The Legacy for this year does a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. They've certainly done a lot to move the car up from being like a 3rd-tier player.. but it still is just not on the level as the big guys from Japan, and it has Subaru's REALLY annoying practice of THIS ENGINE ONLY option packages. For example, the 2.5L Turbo 4 is considered the performance engine, and yet Subuaru's advanced LSD is only available with the 3.0L flat six, which is only available with an automatic. What? What genius thought that one up?The G6 I havent heard much about, but I was entirely underwhelmed by the ""new"" Grand Prix, so my guess is it will probably be the old Grand Am minus body cladding and some more curvey lines. Yawn. The TSX is a rather interesting choice, as it doesnt really fit with the above mentioned cars. The TSX will lose stop light races to most of the V6s, but its in a handling class way above any Solara. If you're really interested in the TSX, I suppose the Altima SE-R could qualify as competition, but then I would also look at cars such as the G35, IS300, and maybe a 325i. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

I know that probably sounds wierd, but I've owned Jags since '96, and if you're going from an Acura to a Jag, I think you're going to be unpleasantly surprised about the problems that are going to crop up rather early in the ownership experience. Electrical failures galore. Is there a reason that the '04 Acura TL, or '05 Infiniti G35 arent on that list? The ES is a great car, but if you're looking for a ""fun"" driving experinece as with the 325i and to a lesser extent C class, the ES and Jag arent it. The TL and G35 offer GOBS more power than the BMW and Mercedes, and in my opinion, handle just as well.If bad weather handling is an issue, the '05 Infiniti G35x offers AWD, combined with 277hp and 270lb.ft. of torque, something Germany cant beat, not unless you get an E500 4matic or A6 2.7T Sline, for only about $45K+ for the Audi, and $60K+ for the Mercedes.

Yes, that's one of the things that's scaring her about the Jag....horror stories of them always being in the shop. It's just always been that car that she's always wanted....although...that was really some of the older models that she loved....she's not ""in love"" with the S-type. May I ask if your current Jag is a late model? The reason the Infiniti is not on the list is she doesn't like the look of the car...and the Acura...a combination of not liking the news lines of the car..and the problems she's had with her current Acura. And yes, the driving experience between the Mercedes and Bmw is totally different from that of the Jag and Lexus...that's where they each have something comes in. The latter two are much more luxurious inside...and the Jag has a more distinctive....not like every other car on the road look to it. The first two have more handling and responsiveness on their plus list rather than interior luxury. I imagine we'll be out testing them all again today! Thanks for your input! ",Posts: 120,Member

I've owned three Jaguars, a '94 XJS-V12 convertible that I bought in '96, a '98 XK8 convertible that I bought in '00, and a '00 XKR that I currently have that I bought two years ago. If you've noticed a pattern here, its that I have always bought the cars two years old, and I havent kept any for long. The initial depreciation hit on Jaguars is BRUTAL, and it kind of stays that way. You can buy a '98 or '99 XJR sedan, Jags top supercharged $80K+ car, for literally in the teens now. I also havent kept any of my Jags past 35K miles, because they just become too much of a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] after that. Reliability on my '94 XJ was the worst of the trio, but interestingly enough I liked it the best. Sure the V12 was a maintanence hog, and the power was only about as much as a standard XK8, but it was a JAGUAR, whith a Jaguar engine, and a beautifully crafted interior. Neither my XK8 or XKR have retained that feeling. The V8s are Ford sourced. The plastics and vinyls have no business being in a Jaguar. The interior of the initial run of the S-type was absolute garbage. They have improved apon it since then, but it's still not nearly as good as it should be. Quite frankly I think the ES330 blows it away in that respect. If she doesnt like the styling of the new TL thas one thing, but comparing it to a '93 Vigor with its.. lets just say not great 5 cylinder is hardly fair. Acura is way above Jag, BMW, and MB in terms of long term reliability, pretty much almost as good as Lexus. ","Posts: 6,419",Member

This actually is a question about a type of VW beetle. I was driving around town and saw a VW in a used car dealership's parking lot. It was strange looking to me, so I took a friend over to see it. He's fairly mechanical when it comes to cars. He said it a regular old VW, but the hood is like a Rolls-Royce. I'm wondering if anyone else has seen one like this and where I could find one for a nice price if I was going to buy one. ",Posts: 1,Member

Hello I am trying to see what would be the best bet in buying a sedan. My cieling is $14500, can't go past that. Basically I am a first-time buyer and I want to make the smartest decision possible. Do I go for the reliability of Honda/Toyota or the value of Hyundai/Kia? Any feedback would be appreciated.Now, here are my deal options (all auto tranny):1) '05 Toyota Corolla CE out the door - $13,5k -like the deal because reliable car plus 3 yr bumper/5 year powertrain warranty2) '04 Honda Civic VP out the door - $14,4k - reliable and great mpg but only 3yr bumper warranty, no powertrain3)'04 Kia Spectra - $10,5k out the door - cheap price, great warranty but I've heard it makes too much noise and warranty service is suspect. Plus really bad depreciation rate. Still good value though4) '04 Hyundai Elantra $11k out the door - again cheap price but bad depreciation rate, not as reliable as Honda or Toyota?...thoughts?

Hi, I am not sure where to post this. Been driving an '86Chevy Celebrity,with bench-like seats, and need a new car desperately. I want a midsize car, preferably $19-$23K. I am a new-car buyer, feel uncomfy w/used. My husband's 88Toyota is better quality than my car, so I tried imports. Fell in love with the '05 Toyota Camry LE, BUT inadequate thigh support. I have VERY long legs. I am 3"" shorter than my hubby, yet my waist is about 4"" taller than his. So the seat pan is too short, and I have back pain from inadequate thigh support. I had a Camry LE test drive recently, and adjusted the seat back backwards, to push my tush back and used a pillow from ""Relax the Back"" to put my back upright, which usually keeps me comfy. (I also rented the car for the weekend, before i got the pillow)Could not get comfortable!  Adjusted the seat pan upward in front, but still not supportive/comfy. Got severe back spasm when I got out of the short test drive! I am soooo dissappointed, because I loved the car. Does anyone have any more ideas or a mid-size sedan that has more thigh support? The Toyota salesperson said people who are comfy with domestic cars don't like import car seats, but I don't know where to start! I loved the idea that the Camry is very crash-worthy, dependable, smooth, and i like the layout of the interior. I thought about the Avalon, but it's too big, pricey, and I don't like buying used cars(a used Avalon would probably be in my price range). I also have carpal tunnel, and so have to be careful to buy lighter weight doors and watch ergonomics. Can't drive those Mazdas or Nissans with the wiggly shift gear. Hope you can help!!!

For a good bargain, current Taurus seats are very comfortable, and if you are coming from an old Celebrity, even a base Taurus will run circles around it in every way, but I would spring for one with the Duratec V-6 engine if you can afford it over the Vulcan base V-6, though it is adequate as well.We once had a 1983 Celebrity, replaced it with a 90 Taurus kept for ten years and now have a 2000 Taurus. Have been very happy with it. You may be able to get a leftover 2004 model with huge rebates and keep your cost well under $20K.Ford is also introducing the 2005 model year Five Hundred and I would bet this will have comfy supporting base cushion seats as well. The 500 is more ""state of the art"", but will be somewhat pricier as well, especially until supplies increase and dealers are willing to deal. ","Posts: 1,565",Member

Thanks maxhonda99!!!I'll give those cars a look. I did a short test drive of the Accord, but I was so in love with the Camry at the time that all I noticed was the bumpy ride of the Accord (the Camry just floats!). It was after that short Accord test drive that I did a longer Camry test drive and had the terrible back spasms.I did take a peek at the Impala interior after seeing your message, while checking out the Chevy Malibu. The seat does have a longer cushion. Just more than I planned to pay. I may test drive the Impala.The Taurus is something I haven't seen yet, and I will check that out, also.I also noticed that I have to drive these new cars differently. In my current car, I can rest my foot on the floor and swivel my foot to go from gas to brake. Can't do that with the new cars so far because the brake sits higher. I thought the Chevy Malibu's adjustable pedals might help, but there's a big bump in the middle/in the way, and the pedals don't come down low enough. I decided to start lifting my foot to brake in my current car, to help build up right leg muscles. Maybe that will help my back to resist spasm attacks. And maybe give me more options. I don't know.But thanks so much for your suggestions!!! Getting ideas from someone is comforting. ",Posts: 100,Member

The 98-00 Altima's are reliable but their crash test results are behind the Accord and Camry. However, they offer good performance and a cheaper price tag. The Accord does have a transmission recall but I know several people who have an Accord from that year and their transmissions have been fine. You do have the 100,000 warranty to fall back on though.Using this criteria ""sporty, fun, quick, powerful, gas saving, and easy to drive."" the Accord seems like the best choice. The Camry is another nice car. The engine is slightly underpowered compared to the competition though. And one thing you want to look out for is engine sludge. This is a known problem with several of Toyota's engines from that time period.bh628: FWIW, I have a 2004 Accord EX-L and the seats are very comfortable. They were even comfortable when I was 9 months pregnant. If you found the ride of the Accord bumpy the dealer may have had the tire pressure too high. I've had 3 of the 03+ Accords and 2 of the 3 had too much air in the tires giving it a bumpier ride. Although the Accord will have a firmer ride than the Camry regardless. ","Posts: 4,202",Member

setzer: If your wife wants room I would stay away from the X3. Since it's based on the 3-series it will probably be lacking the space of your other choices and will get even tighter once the baby arrives.Out of the three the RX330 is probably the most refined, the X3 will probably be the sportiest, and the FX35 should be the best deal.

Go for the Galant or Elantra. Stay far, far away from the Stratus and Grand Am. Between the Elantra and Galant I would go for the Galant. It's a larger car with decent crash tests. I know some people have complained of brake issues in the Galant but that was mostly for the early years of the 99 redesign. The Elantra isn't a bad choice if you prefer a smaller car.

CR gives the Galant and Elantra better ratings than the Stratus. Also, from personal experience through my employer and friends, the Stratus would be more problematic on average and the body integrity isn't as good as the Galant. The Stratus does better than the Galant in frontal impacts according to NHTSA though. However, the Galant does better in side impact crash tests.If I were you I would look at both and see which is more comfortable then you can weigh the pros and cons more accurately.

I was looking at Mazda3 also. Nice looks and good power. I have also looked at Elantra GT. Also has nice looks and I love that purple intrument panel. I don't know why, but having a nice gauge cluster is important to me.  Build quality is one of the top priorities. The Cavi has never left me stranded, but at 97,000 miles, the interior has squeaks and rattles everywhere and its pretty annoying. The 93 Civic I owned previously had none of those problems even at 130,000 miles and 9 years old.  I am not sure about Hyundai's quality. I have heard they aren't that great, but more and more I hear that they now rival the Japanese makes. Also am not sure of Mazda's quality as they are owned by Ford and I think that the 2.3 engine is a Ford Duratec.  Also, mid size sedans are not out of the question. I like the looks of the Camry, but I think Honda really screwed up with the new accord's design, I hate the front fascia.  So, as of now, the contenders are Civic, Corolla, Elantra, Mazda3, RSX, and maybe Camry.  I want to make sure I get what models to seriously consider, learn as much about each as I can, and then, take the test drives as an informed consumer, making my decision to get the best value and best car to suit me.

I've asked around for reccomendations but no one really knows anyone.  I have test driven a few cars from lots, i even found one that i really liked i almost bought it but at the last minute i took ot to a mechanica and he told me the repairs that needed doing on the car were more than the asking price!!!  I can afford to make monthly payments but theres no way i can get credit because i have only just arrived and i only need the car for the next 18 months.  So my question is what car should i buy and how and where should i buy it?  - My number one requirement is reliabilty, i need the car for 18 months and i need it not to give me too much trouble. my communte to work is less than 10 minutes but i plan to make some road trips (3+ hours) in the car as well - I would prefer a smaller compact sedan, that goes easy on gas and insurance, but one with 4 doors - I have always driven manual cars so i am more than happy with either manual or auto - I'm not too fussy about the make, style, color or age, the above things are more important - I need it as soon as possible, preferably within a week, i don't have much time to shop around  thanks for your help, alex ",Posts: 1,Member

Car lots pay $1500 for $2000 cars, then sell them for $3000.. If your budget is that low, try to purchase a car for around $1500 from a private seller, then keep about $500 back for repairs...  There really isn't a $2000 car that you can count on for 18 months with no repairs needed.. The fact that you want a manual will help your search.. they generally sell for much less than automatics in that price range...  regards, kyfdx ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

My wife's car was stolen last week, and I'm beginning to think about replacing it. I'm 25, live in Berkeley, and have driven an 89 Corolla wagon passed on to me when I got my license, and it's still going strong at 147k miles. I'll probably drive it until it dies. My wife was driving a 92 Accord (198k miles) passed on to her from her mother until it was stolen.   Neither of us has purchased a car before. I've been reading through information and forums here, and I'm still unsure about what to narrow my focus on. I'm hoping to get some advice.   I'm looking for a car with good long term value. For now the car would be used primarily for my wife commuting, and probably for occasional road trips for the two of us. Safety, reliability, mileage, and cost are important to me. Style, capacity, luxury, resale value, and brand name are not in themselves important to me. I'm not too worried about depreciation, since we're generally willing to keep driving our cars until it's no longer practical to do so. My wife only drives automatics right now, so I'd prefer to get one of those, though I'm trying to teach her manual (since my car is a stick and is currently our only vehicle). If a manual is a significantly better value, we might be willing to go for it.   I'm willing to purchase a new or used car. We have money saved, so we could reasonably use cash to purchase a new car and drive it 10-15+ years. I'd really appreciate some advice, both general and specific.   1) Would you recommend getting a used or new car? 2) Are there specific models and years that you would recommend? (Even links would be cool)   Thanks, latham ",Posts: 33,Member

I like an '01-'02 Chevy Prizm.. It is a twin to the Toyota Corolla, but cheaper used.. You should be able to find a low-mileage example for around $6000-$7500... It should last as long as the current cars you have been driving..  regards, kyfdx ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

I've been combing used car ads looking for a good value. Here are four I'm currently considering. I haven't yet followed up on these ads, so I'm not yet certain that there's not something hidden wrong, or that perhaps the price is negotiable lower.

Maybe you should look into leasing a car instead of buying.I don't know if you can get only an 18 month lease, and you may run into problems with credit also with this approach, so this option may not be feasible either.Otherwise, San Diego has nice weather pretty much all year long. Maybe a bicycle or motor scooter is what you need. Then rent a car for your few long road trips.It will be difficult to find a reliable used car for $2000. ","Posts: 1,565",Member

Maybe you could find a reasonably well-mainted 86-91 Accord or 97-91 Camry. Get a base model manual transmission and you should be able to get by with bare-bones maintenance. Heck, maybe even a early 90's Protege or Civic. The key is to look at base models and not get picky about color, exterior condition, etc and worry about mileage and mechanical condition.Another option might be a mid-90's Escort.

Even though it comes with some bells and whistles standard, make sure you check out the Hyundai Elantra. Just got a steal on one, and I don't think you can beat the value. Definitely has good reliability (unlike former Hyundai's) with the best warranty to back it up, decent gas mileage (though not as good as Honda/Toyota, but you will more than make the difference back in price).

What are your other criteria? There are lots that offer that, but I'm not sure anyone can give you a concrete list of ALL those that do. You probably ought to try to fit your other criteria to available vehicles and then see whether this particular option is listed in the specs for the ones that seem to be a good fit for you.Maybe if you give us more information about what is important to you, we can point you in the right direction.

From a BMW owner,Get the Infiniti. The 525is lacks umph (especially if paired with an automatic tranny). The only issue is that the M35 is a 1st year model which means there is a higher likelihood of bugs, design flaws. BMW commands a market premium price which only you can judge if it is worth it. If it were my money, I would consider a recently used bmw 530i instead (assume same $ range). Just my opinion, good luck. ",Posts: 4,Member

HAAAALP! I am sooo undecided. It's between a 1994 Toyota Camry with 1 owner, 76K miles on it, broken a/c, but I know the owner and he said it's been a good running car, asking $3K. However, I am tired of driving a ""bland"" car and my heart is on a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero from a dealership with 43K miles on it. I don't care about resale value since I plan to keep the car whichever one I choose but if I choose the Toyota, it means no monthly car payments but if I choose the Alero, I will be happy with the look of the car but it will mean car payments.

If you are on a budget, avoid high-line cars out of warranty.. They will make you cry..

Why not an American sedan with Volvo design input and safety systems? Ford Five Hundred. You can get your AWD and stay very well south of $30K.Further advice: Buy don't lease and drive the wheels off the car. (Say ten years and 120K miles or so or more. You will be much money ahead. Your lease rates of $397-420 a month, even assuming nothing down, means you are spending $14292 to $15120 for three years of driving, and at the end you have nothing to show for it except a depleted bank account.

If the advice is still on time, I agree with Badgerfan about one thing: don't lease, buy. When you lease, you're for the most expensive part of the car, the first 2-3 years of depreciation. Then you have to start over again.In your price range, I'd suggest a Volve S40w/AWD; an Acura TSX--it's not European, but derived from the European market, and the refinement, handling, and (to a lesser degree) speed criteria apply; or one of the remodeled Jettas (if you like the old one so much).Stay away from the Saab and the Ford Five Hundred--both are getting relatively poor reviews, and the Five Hundred especially would not have the handling or speed you mention as desireable. On top of that, look at J.D. Power for reliability and problems per vehicle. Some makes are consistently more problem-prone than others.Hope this helps... ",Posts: 22,Member

To make a long story short, I've suffered some ear damage from attending a car race and then later a long plane flight. As a result, I have ringing in my ears and my ears are very sensitive to engine noise - it seems the engine is 2-3 times as loud as it was before. So, to avoid more damage, I've been wearing earplugs while I drive - I'm also thinking about trading in one of my cars for a quieter one.Can anyone provide recommendations of cars that are very quiet, especially with respect to engine noise? Also, are there good rules of thumb, such as whether a V6 or 4 cylinder, or certain makes of cars, are quieter than others? I currently have a 92 Camry and an 02 Solara and the Camry is actually a little easier on me. Also, I found a thread on here from around 3 years ago that said that Lincoln Town Cars are the quietest ones out there, is that still the case?Thanks,Todd ",Posts: 2,Member

My husband has the same problem as you do and we also are looking for the quietest car we can find. In Consumer Reports the luxury sedans have the highest ratings regarding quiet. These are cost prohibitive, however.Interesting that you mention that your Camry is quieter that your Solara because that is what I found. The higher end Camry - the XLE V6 has the highest rating regarding quiet and won't break the bank. I think I would buy the best Camry with crash protect side air bags which is highly recommended to add as without them it received a Poor rating in the IIHS side-crash test. With them it received the BEST rating.I'm going to speak to my husband about this tonight. Sounds like the best idea to me. Good luck to you. From experience, this can be a devastating ailment. We moved to a very quiet house, bought an LG refrigerator which from much research has the lowest decibel level I could find. Noise level is the FIRST criteria in anything I buy these days. Panasonic seems to make a quiet bathroom ventilation fan as well as a quiet exhaust fan for over the stove.-Lynn ",Posts: 1,Member

I'm 19 years old and looking to buy myself a used car. I've got my eye on a 2001 Acura Integra that is at the Saturn dealership where I live. I'll give a basic rundown of what I currently know about the car, although I'll be getting more information (declarations, etc.) about it soon.The car costs $13,970CDN ($11,368US), and has 81,400 kilometres (50,579 miles) on it. It was previously a lease car, apparently accident free, although I'll be asking for the declarations of the vehicle or get information through the bank (depending on how I finance it). It's been through a 150 point inspection by the dealership and they are offering a 5,000 kilometre warranty, although I'm sure I can get a better warranty from them without having to pay more. I'm going to the dealership today (hopefully before they close) to get more information.From what is known, does anything think this is a car I should avoid? I suppose we won't really know until I have declarations and service records, but so far everything seems to look great. Only problem I have with the car are the rims and tires, would prefer nicer rims and larger tires. ",Posts: 6,Member

Greetings! I'm a former owner of a '00 ES300 and '02 ES300. I *absolutely* loved the prestige of driving a Lexus. The color combo of the '00 was graphite/black and the '02 was gold/cream. I definitely prefer the black interior and I have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seats, passenger control climate, moonroof, speed controlled volume, etc. The '02 had a Nav system, rain sensor wipers, and more bells and whistles than I could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a Camry and I would prefer s distinct style in my vehicle. (I actually walked up to a Camry on several occasions thinking it was mine). :blush: So now I'm looking at the '02 or '03 GS430 (I like the luxury sport sedan combo), the '04 G35 and the '04 or '05 Acura TL. I'm hearing great things about the Nav system in the TL which is not a need but a definite desire. Some of the things that I have not experienced but would like to have are:-Bluetooth capability (I didn't have a Bluetooth capable phone when I had the '02)-Steering wheel controls for radio/cd-DVD/CD Player-Voice commands for Nav-Traffic guidance for Nav(I hear these last 2 items are features of the TL's nav system)Oh and my price range is low 30's. :P Yes, I know I want the world. (But what's a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before she's unable to do so?) I'm not sure I want to give up driving a Lex but I just might have to. Any thoughts? ",Posts: 9,Member

Based upon your requirements...the 2005 TL is my recommendation (and which I own).Why I would recommend? If you enjoy the luxury of a Lexus, then the TL has the mix for you. The interior is definitely superior to the G35...and will remind you of the Lexus GS series. It even rivals my 2004 BMW 7 series.Features....it has all the items you have indicated. Bluetooth...controls, etc. If you order them through the G35...you are looking to add $7k above the TL through a package. Stereo...6 CD indash changer...with 8 speakers with universally accepted superior performance. Controlled with buttons on the steering wheel.Dual climate zones. Power seats. All the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy. Performance...well it has 270 hp and the latest Car and Driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the BMW 3 series. Past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class.As for pricing...you can get a non-navigation TL for about $30.5k...nav for about $32k. G35...$37k+ with horrible 16MPG in mixed driving. Get a similarily equiped BMW 3 series...pay $48k. Lexus GS...pay $50k+.If you really want something different...look at the TL in Dark Green exterior with the Parchment or Camel interior...which will have wood trims included at no cost. That is sharp and similar to the Lexus interior.So yes...you can have the world! And you will never pine to drive your Lex again. ",Posts: 744,Member

You won't go too wrong with any of them, although VW is a question mark for reliability. It probably comes down to, which car do you like the best? By the way, you can get leather added aftermarket -- I did that on my Mazda6 and it's great. Why can't you afford a Maxima? An '02 or '03 should cost around the same as the VW or the newer Mazda6. I have an '01, and I think it blends the best of all the above cars! More fun to drive than a Camry or Accord, but reliability in that ballpark. Better gas mileage than my Mazda6 wagon too (both are V6). ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I think they're all good cars, but I'll just talk about the Passat & Mazda, 'cause based on your few comments, I think they're your preference.I wouldn't be too concerned with Passat's reliability. I had an '01.5 for 4 years. There was 1 major issue that would've cost me $500, but the extended warranty covered it (which is why I probably don't recall the problem). Anyway, 1 problem in 4 years is nothing to complain about. I know I'm just 1 person, but if you check out consumer reports, VW reliability is pretty good. I don't think it's as high as Toyota and Honda, but it's ""above ave"" in general. Still, you should find out how much of the initial warranty is left. For me, the main concern with a Passat is that you're buying a car that's been redesigned, so your resale is gonna stink. Still, of the cars you mentioned, I thiink the Passat will be the most fun ('cause your not including a Mazda6 hatchback or sedan).Re the Mazda, they have good reliability. The knock on Mazda is that they don't always use top-quality interior materials (same criticism crops up with Nissan), but if you like it, that's all that matters. I think the Mazda would also be more fun than the Accord and Camry and the wagon adds utility to the equation (though the Passat has a very nice sized and laid out trunk). If you browse through Edmunds, you'll see they really liked the Mazda6.Personally, if the Mazda is the only one that'd be a 6 cyl, that's the car I'd want. If they were all 6 cyl, I'd probably prefer the Passat (although the Passat's 6 cyl was underpowered by '03, I think it'd have the most luxurious interior) ",Posts: 681,Member

I like them all just fine- reliability is my biggest concern, but who wouldn't like something that doesn't look like a. everyone else or b. grandma?As far as what I can get- I haven't researched/mentioned to wholesaler the Passat yet- I am undecided.Accords are hard to come by, Camrys easy, and he said he could get me Mazda6's all day long- and I found an 04 with 2K miles, leather, at a local dealership that I could get to the top of my price range.I have read a lot, but so many articles are biased. The accord always comes out on top, Camry varies, everyone likes Passat styling, and Mazda6 is just sort-of there, has good feedback on handling, ok on comfort.Thanks for the input so far- its making me think!!!

Hi, I'm in Canada. I'm looking for a car. I like the ""sedans"" look. I was thinking of leasing a new car, but the insurance will cost me a lot and I guess owning is always better. So here's my plan, please help:I'm looking for a car used around the 2001-2003 year, and in the 8,000-12,000 canadian dollars range (in US dollars it's a little less). My main concern is reliability, I don't want to have to spend a lot of money on repairing the car in the future, I want it to last. Obviously I also care about the look of the car and that I'm attracted to it, etc. but the reliability and quality are the most important thing. What would you say are the top 5 or top 10 used cars based on the price range and the year range that I have? i'm guessing the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Mazda Protege would be good guesses. I don't like the Toyota Corolla's look at all, so that leaves the Honda Civic and Mazda Protege. I think the Honda Civic 2001-2003 would be in the upper corner of my price range from what I've seen, but still it's a possibility. The Mazda Protege prices are pretty good. Are there many other used sedans in that price & year range that are RELIABLE and that I would make me relax my head and not worry too much about all sorts of problems with the car in the future? The last thing I want is to buy a used car and spend a lot of money on repairing it in the upcoming years because it's not very reliable.Please help me. Thank you!P.S: although I posted this in the sedans forum and it's my preference, it doesn't necessarly have to be a sedan so please don't limit your choices too much. ",Posts: 5,Member

Check out the Mitsubishi Galant, and maybe a Lancer. Their reliability is generally fine, but for some reason, have poor resale value, which make them a good buy on the used market. The Galant is a larger car, and the Lnacer is more in line with the other cars you mentioned, but has a funky look that might turn you off.Don't know too much about them, so you should check out the reviews on Edmunds.com. Hope this helps.Also, I've rented a lot of Chevy Malibus - before the redesign - and thought they rode well. Don't know about reliability, but they might be worth a look, and if you're interested in a car that rental companies carry, you could probably get a good bargain buy buying from a rental agency.Lastly, I think the Ford Taurus and Oldsmobile Olero always got good reviews ( Taurus was known to have some rattles), and since they've been discontinued, their resale may have taken a nosedive, too.As for reliabilty, I bet Edmunds has info on all of them, or you might want to subscribe to Consumer Reports' online access, so can search their database.Hope this helps.

I suggest you buy a 2000 civic EX coupe (5 speed manuel) rather than a 2001- model because 2000 civic has double wishbone front suspension which is cornering very good and the body lean will be very little even turn at a high speed. The 127hp is very sufficient for highway passing. It is very reliable. I have a 97 which has 136,000 miles on it which seldom has any problem. I had one 97 Lancer before, the handling cannot be compared with Civic.Make sure to check out if the civic is in good condition and no modification. ",Posts: 327,Member

Hi guys.I'm planing to buy brand new Civic LX sdn at 15,700, dealer sugested price. But one year later though it will be still excellent, I may have to resell this car after my study. The mileages will be less than 10,000 by that time. If I resell my car at 14,000 and if the car will be kept perfect, would you like to buy my car? I just want to know that my decision will be right.In fact, I decided to buy brand new one after thinking over a couple of weeks between new one and used one. and finally I concluded that buying new car would save more money after one years later. I know used cars cost less money and may save more. But as you learn from my English, I am a forigen studnet and It's very hard for me to figure out a good way to choose an intact used car.a best kept one-year used Civic with 10,000miles for $14,000 !.what do you guys think?

I think you're better off buying a used car with more than 2 years left on the warranty, so that if you resell it, you can still resell it with a warranty.Keep in mind that many items that make a car cost more (a/c, leather, power windows, automatic transmission) also make it easier and mroe valuable during resale. Therefore, while I stand by my intial statement regardless, if your decision is between a base model new Civic or a used Civic with options, you are better off taking the car with options.Also, don't buy one in a funky color like orange and purple - they are trendy and more difficult to resell.If I resell my car at 14,000 and if the car will be kept perfect, would you like to buy my car?I suggest you use Edmunds to calculate what a 1 year old Civic, like what you're planning on buying, is worht now. I assume you're looking at an '05, so look at what an '04 with 10,000 mi is worth.PS - there are also sites for people looking to get out of their lease early. I imagine that if you search the web, you can find a site or 2 and maybe see if someone is looking to get out of an inexpensive lease with about a year left. ",Posts: 681,Member

I think Nissan makes very good cars, and if it came to buying a domestic or a japanese car, I would go for the japanese, because of its quality. Now I would buy a 3-4 yr old car if I were to keep it and drive it down to the ground. I've heard that Maximas are good, but be very careful when you buy used. One thing you have to be comfortable with is that you would probably have to change the tires soon, then also do other maintenance if needed. Otherwise if you get the car at a good price, as according to blue book, and the car is sound, and has a clean title, then you should be fine. Instead of buying to a dealer, I would check if someone is wanting to sale his car because the lease is coming to an end. Those are usually good deals because leased cars are usually taken good care of. So I would mainly check private paries and try to obtain financing through a bank. You might go to a dealer, but the price will probably be much higher than if you got it from a private party. Check price on kelly blue book under private party if buying through private person. Check price on kelly blue book under retail, if buying through dealer. Mileage should be around 12K - 15K per year, so a 4 yr old car should have around 60k miles. But sometimes the decision of either buying through dealer or private party is based on financing and your credit status. So if you have good credit, use it wisely. ",Posts: 146,Member

based on your criteria, I agree with your host. On the Jetta, I forget whetehr it was redesigned for '05 or '06. If '06, you could save probably a lot of $$$$ if you're not interested in the new model changes and go for an '05. If the redesign was in '05, I would stick with '06s only.Same with the Civic - I sut don't know what changes were made and whether they were major or minor.As an aside, I would enjoy the Jetta over the Civic. It has a much nicer interior, IMO, which makes the ride that much more enjoyable.You could probably do very will on the Jetta if you were willing to buy used.

Of course AWD will make a difference, as would FWD, as would use of snow tires. Remember, nothing can ""create traction."" All one can do is maximize the traction you have.FWD maximizes traction by keeping the engine's weight over the wheels that drive the car. AWD maximizes traction by providing power to whatever wheels have traction. Still, its up to the tires to establish traction, and snow tires are the best at doing that.Before discarding a car over bad traction, find out what tires are standard and see how they rate for snow traction - many people like to use tirerack.com. Depending on how they rate, you can see if the car comes with another tire option, or you can try to swap them out as an aftermarket dealer option (don't know how succsful you would be with that, though). You could also invest in a pair of snow tires. Considering that snow tires will help your regular tires last longer ('cause they won't get used between December and March) I think the main issue is whether you have the storage.That being said, please realize that since I never researched BMWs or Audis, I'm not really answering your exact question of which is better in the snow.

Both cars are new and the Maxima can be purchased for only $400 more. I know they are different cars but the Maxima has more features (memory seats, auto dimming rear view mirror, home link, and more) but do not like the dash and orange lighted instruments. The Passat has nicer dash and interior and is rated higher in gas mileage. Currently own 97 Maxima GLE and 2000 VW GTI with VR6 and like both cars.

If speed and acceleration is your primary issue, then I'd go with the Maxima, but I think the Passat is an overall better car.I had a 2001.5 v6 Passat, which had 10 less hp than the 1 your considering. Actually, if 200 hp is under the new ratings, then the model you're looking at probably got about 240 hp under the old system. If you're comparing HP to HP, make sure you get the #s under the same test.Anyway, I know several people who were turned off by the Maxima b/c of the significant torque steer, even in the luxuray model. My Passat was a bit underppowered, but still fun to drive. It handled well for its class and the interior was so luxurious, I constantly got compliments from passengers and valet drivers.So, all-in-all, if HP is the deciding factor, make sure you compare both cars under the same system. Otherwise, I'd go with the Passat. ",Posts: 681,Member

Hp not my total concern, the creature comforts on the Maxima SL ( memory seats, mirrors and steering wheel, home link and auto dimming rear view mirrors both inside and out) that attracted me. I agree that the Passat seems like a nicer car and the torque on the 2.0T (207 ft. lbs.) really moved the car. For some reason VW chose to keep the desired features mentioned for the 3.6L Passat that is just coming out. Of course that car will be well into the upper $30K range which is out of my budget.

I don't think the side-mirrors dim, but it'd have everything else and just slightly less HP than the Passat you're considering. Still, that drop to 190 could be too much when compared tot he Maxima.

I had my eye on a 2005 Passat GLX (new) that had everything including an acceptable silver gray color. $31,440 list that they would let go for $25550. Took my wife out for a test spin and she thought it road hard like my 2000 VW GTI GLX. She liked the ride of the new 2006 Passat and thought its interior design was done with a women in mind. So that took care of the 2005 model. The 2006 Passat has similar automatic air like my GTI GLX which also is loaded with features. The Maxima though has not only automatic air but dual zone operation. It has all the features that the 3.6L Passat will have with the added packages for I believe $10K more than the 2005 Maxima. I like the Passat but have a problem giving up all that features on the Maxima but than that ugly dash and orange lighting on the gauges. ",Posts: 91,Member

The Passat does have great dash colors, but the floating gauges on the Maxima is kinda cool, too. It does have floating gauges, right (gauges move with the steering column during adjustments)? I saw it on the 350 and it looked the same on the Maxima, but I didn't try it out. ",Posts: 681,Member

I drove a 2005 Maxima SL and it looked like the gauge cluster was fixed to the sloping dash. The steering wheel was interesting as it had a joy stick on the steering shaft that would electrically move the steering wheel. This setting was part of the memory system. Also when you shut the car off and pulled the key the seat would move back to ease your exit from the vehicle. I failed to mention that the side view mirrors also tilt down when you back up so you can see how close you are to the curb. I am slowing selling myself on this car. ",Posts: 91,Member

Also when you shut the car off and pulled the key the seat would move back to ease your exit.I believe that's the easy entry/exit on the Maxi. My '03 Maxi SE has that feature and a heated steering wheel. I think the new '04-'05Maxi has that same feature. I don't know any other cars in this price range that has heated steering wheel. If you live in the northern states and you don't always wear gloves in the winter, you'll apppreciate it.Two things that I don't like about the Maxi (I test drove '04 Maxi SE) are wide-turning diameter and rough/choppy ride.  I've been taking quite a few long-distance (300+ miles) trips, and everytime I wish I had brought my other car (TL-S) instead. Maybe, I'll trade in the Maxi for an Accord Hybrid. Easier ride + better gas mileage. :blush: The '06 Avalon is also interesting, but again: wide-turning circle. ",Posts: 94,Member

I am on my third Maxima (97 GLE) and have been very happy with them. I also looked at an SE both in 90 and 97 but after driving it felt the ride was too harsh. Amazing how much softer ride a GXE or GLE has compared to the SE. I would check out an SL next time as the ride is much more forgiving. This would be an easy decision if I had not driven the 2006 Passat with 2.0T. Just a very nice car but lacks all the creature features. ",Posts: 91,Member

The Avalon is not in the same class as the Maxima and Passat. Avalon is a full-size family sedan that's geared towards comfort and luxury, sized more like the Crown Victoria and lincoln towncar and cars like that. Maybe the Chrysler 300c.

I'm looking to buy a car, and I have about $10K to spend. I've decided I want a ""smallish"" sedan that gets relatively good gas mileage. Here is my dilemna......should I go with an older ('01-'02) Accord/Camry/Altima, or a newer ('03-'04) Grand Am, Alero, Malibu, etc? I know every car is different, and no one here could tell me exactly which car to buy. I'm just looking for some general advice on comparing the quality of a Japanese import with approx. 60k miles to that of an American car of similar size with approx. 30K miles. Are there any general ""rules of thumb"" that may be able to help me decide which would be the best way to go?Thank you very much. ",Posts: 9,Member

I've owned numerous cars - both foreign (or whatever that means these days) and domestic. I typically put >100,000 miles on my cars before I sell or give them away. My honest opinion is that there isn't a whole lot of difference in long-term quality these days. I KNOW there will be plenty of disagreement on this topic, but in my humble opinion it's true. For instance I just gave my 2000 Ford Taurus (120,000 miles) to my Mother-In-Law. Aside from a minor front suspension problem a few years ago - that cost me about $300 - the car was flawless in terms of quality. Was it boring? Yes. Was it an Acura? No. But it cost me $19,000, got me reliably from point A to point B and didn't make me look TOO terrible in the process. Recently however I upgraded to an Acura TL after strongly considering the top-of-the-line Ford Five Hundred. Frankly I think the Ford has more user friendly features than the Acura. BUT, the Acura is an exhilirating drive - something the Five Hundred couldn't match.So you need to figure out what's important to YOU. If quality is truly the most important thing to you then I would carefully review JD Power and Consumer Reports rankings. Many here will argue with how the results are compiled or influenced but I think at the end of the day they're pretty indicative of the product you're getting.Assuming all things are equal - including quality - you might also want to think about resale value. Although I paid $30,000 for my Acura I fully expect it to be worth at least $10,000 in five years (it will only have about 40,000 miles on it) whereas a Taurus with 40,000 miles on it will probably be worth ~$3,000. So for the extra few thousand bucks over a five year period I get a much better (in my opinion) driving experience). If you go with the domestic cars my only recommendation would be to go with the Grand Am. I don't recall that the Alero has received many accolades re: quality. And the Malibu is too new to have a long-term record. The Grand Am has a long history. I'm not sure but if they use the same power plant as the Grand Prix then it's VERY reliable. It's a bit dated, but very reliable. Good luck,Rob ",Posts: 37,Member

As far as researching Consumer Reports Opinions on older models, I'm not positive, but I think that if you subscribe to CRs online website (rather than the print magazine), you can look at back issues.Also, regarding the vehicles you mentioned ('01-'02 Accord/Camry/Altima, '03-'04 Grand Am, Alero, Malibu), I would expect the Altima to be the most fun-to-drive, the Camry to have the smoothest ride and the Accord and Alero to be in-between. I don't recall when the redesigned Altima came out, but I'd stay away from a car built in the 1st model year. Odds of having a problem go up. ",Posts: 681,Member

My mom is finally serious about replacing her '88 Mercedes 300E (she bought used in '91) that has somewhere around 400k miles. She's retired (in her mid-50s), so paying cash, but doesn't want to spend a fortune. She really wants another Mercedes, probably an '02-ish E320. I'm assuming her savings are in decent shape, but my stepdad is about to be unemployed for who knows how long (he's a contract software engineer, lots of jobs being farmed out to India and such), so I'd much rather her be in something a bit less complex and expensive to fix, and with as long a warrranty as possible (why shell out $20k+ to be in a car that you have to pay to fix?). Oh yeah, she lives near Indianapolis, so snow is definitely an issue (try driving an old 300E w/o traction control up a steep driveway in winter), so I'd like her in a FWD; she doesn't seem to care much. Naturally, she wants it to be safe, have a roomy back seat, ample performance and luxury, without being a gas hog. I've come up with a huge range of possibilities in this price range:01-02 Mercedes E320 (anyone know anything about the 4Matic in this range?)00-01 BMW 740iL (nice, but thirsty and expensive to fix as an E320, if not worse)Newish Buick LeSabre (friend has one, she likes the room, otherwise a long shot)03-ish Infiniti I35 (fast, inexpensive used and reliable, not much else-kinda boring)00-03 (last-gen) Acura RL (boring, but probably safe, though not so great MPGs)02-04 Toyota Avalon (see Acura, except better economy)New Accord EX V6 (bit short on lux vs. even older 300E, otherwise perfect IMO)new-as-possible Volvo S80 (nice, fits the bill, but are the bugs worked out yet?)I'm really trying to get her to check out the Accord V6. Since she hasn't bought a car in ~15 years, her perception is kinda stuck back there (when Accords were small, with 4-cylinders and cloth interiors) and her knowledge of current cars is almost nil, IMO. The differences between an Accord V6 and an E320, at least on paper, are not that great any more. The safety factor that used to sell Mercedes back in the day versus other cars doesn't really exist any more, either. Finally, I've heard virtually nothing good, reliability-wise, about any recent Mercedes products. Something tells me she wouldn't get a low-drama 400k (hers was on the old one) out of a newer E320.I'd love anyone's comments--what do you think she'd be happy with? Did I miss something else she ought to check out (Fords and Chryslers, for some reason, are probably not a possibility)? ","Posts: 2,628",Member

Check out the history and the previous posts regarding TL-Ses during that time frame in the Acura TL discussion. Not to scare you off, but they were hit pretty hard by the transmission issues.

I really like the I35. I think it looks nice, handles well and has loads of power. Also, lots of standard equipment, including Xenons and Traction Control. And a great warranty - 4yrs/60k miles bumper to bumper & 6yrs/70k miles powertrain. I put my mother in one. She paid $27,500 three years ago for an '02.Hopefully this reference won't get this post deleted. There are a number of leftover, brand new '04 I35s out there. Do a ""Power Search"" on Autotrader and you can find them. I know of a couple of them at Key Infiniti in South Carolina that have the cold weather package which includes heated steering wheel and seats - both front and back. There are others elsewhere as well. I imagine the dealers are pretty motivated to move them.I have no personal interest in this info. Just passing it along.  ",Posts: 159,Member

I think my mom 'might' consider one. She's a bit of a flake when it comes to cars, she takes forever to decide (duh, she's had her car 14 years) but doesn't do much research, I suspect. She's loyal to Mercedes (I talked her into that 300E), but I'm trying to encourage her to at least look at some others, as there are many nice cars to choose from these days; the car market is a lot different than back then, when Mercedes, BMW and Audi were pretty much the only offerings in the mid-sized sport/lux sedan segment. She (like my brother) tends to treat car buying like buying clothes or a pair of shoes; they won't do it for a while, then will go buy something they think they like without seeing anything else, doing any research or shopping around. It's bizarre. ","Posts: 2,628",Member

Another poster mentioned the Mazda6, and I'd agree that that's worth a look. Before offering my opinion on the other cars, let me tell you my experience: I drive a TL, which is based on the v6 Accord; my grandma has a 4 cyl Camry that I've driven some, and my last car was a Passat, which is a larger version of the Jetta. I'm not familiar with the redesigned Jettas, so consider what I say in that light. I test drove a Mazda6, 6 cyl once.Of the cars you mentioned, I expect the Jetta will have the nicest interior. Of course, you'll pay for that, but if near-luxury is what your looking at, the Jetta may fit the bill. The old Jetta would've been the sportiest of the bunch, but I think the Jetta's increased size leave the Accord as the sportiest of the bunch (if you look at the Mazda6, then the Accord is 2nd sportiest).It's tough for me to talk ""sport"" b/c you don't mention whether you want a 4 cyl or 6, but I can tell you the Accord and Mazda probably have much better handling than the camry.If you wanted a top-of-the-line car, I'd say the Honda v6 w/ leather and nav would be the best combo of luxury and sport. It'll accellerate very well, handle well and have a great navigation system with voice recognition that's really cool.I think the camry will be the most comfortable and have the best resale. Re luxury, I think it'd be more luxurious than the Accord and Mazdo, maybe tied or just below the Jetta.Just 'cause I'm enjoying thinking about this, here's a few rankings:MOST LUXURY TO LEAST:1. Jetta; 2. Camry; 3. Accord; 4. Mazda6MOST SPORTY TO LEAST1. Mazda6; 2. Accord; 3. Jetta; 4. CamryMOST COMFORTABLE RIDE TO LEASTjust reverse the order under ""SPORTY""Hope this helps!!!

 I currently lease a 2003.5 G35 (6MT) that is coming off a 39 month lease in about 9 months. I thought I will get opinions early!:)While I love my G, and seriously considered buying it at the end of the lease, I have a strong variety seeking streak. I am thinking primarily of the 2006 Acura TL (I know it is FWD but torque steer has apparently been reduced) and the BMW 330i. Other cars I could consider are the Audi A4 3.0, the Mercedes C class (3.5), Volvo S60R and even, perhaps, the Saab 9-3. Of course, I will only consider manual transmission cars. My primary use of the car is for personal transportation to work (short commute), occasional long distance travel with family (usually 4 of us), and infrequent banzai runs on the back roads to clear the cobwebs!:)I would appreciate your opinion on the best car for me.

knr5,I can only speak to the S60R as that was a close choice for me before picking up my G35 6MT coupe. I really liked the 'Vader' as I called it, black on black on black. It was a very nice driving car. It can be smooth and it can handle very well for a sedan. I do know they were VERY willing to deal, I think I recall about a 38k price if I were to lease it. It had every gadget in the book and for me it was a tough choice. In the end it came to number of doors, we have a 05 Murano and we wanted this car to be the ""fun"" car. If it were just myself, I think I would have picked the Volvo. I just loved the sleeper aspect and the dealer was a hoot.All I can say is have some fun and go drive some cars!! ",Posts: 4,Member

I have an '04 TL 6MT w/ summer tires and love it!!! With respect to your comment that they fixed the torque steer in '06, from what I understand, the put something on the car that reduces the power to the wheels when torque steer is sensed. Frankly, it sounds similar to traction control - how it reduces accelleration to help the wheels catch.I view this as a negative - if you want to avoid torque, you can simply accellerate more slowly.I do love the car, and my torque issues were significantly reduced when I put on new tires. Apparently, good traction on the tires reduces the pull tot he side. Anyway, 1 last comment on the TLs torque - I only notice it when trying to accellerate as fast as possible from a dead stop. I don't notice it on downshifts, curves or anything else while the car is alreadymoving.Re the Volvo S60R, I wish I checked it out while I was looking. Not that I'd trade my TL for anything in the world, but I would've liked to have experienced the Volvo. From what I've read, it will not handle as well as the others in your search.For that matter, while I would expect the TL to have the nicest interior of the bunch, the G35 and BMW are probably mor sport-oriented. For me (I drive like you - mainly commuting with a fun ride now and then), the TL has been perfect. SPorty enough to enjoy when there's no traffic, with an interior and soundsystem I can enjoy always. ",Posts: 681,Member

Thank you taxesquire and kaitai69 for your responses!:)I think I will take a serious look at the Volvo S60R also. The TL and the Audi A4 are easy to test back to back since the Infiniti dealer also carries Acura and Audi. The Volvo dealership is different, but closer to me! I seriously considered the Audi A4 and the Saab 9-5 (also test drove the 9-3) the last time around. Unfortunately, at that time, the TL was available only as an automatic.The MT choices in the sensible sporty sedan category (the near-near-luxury class, if one can call it that) are very attractive indeed -- Accord V6 EX, MazdaSpeed 6 AWD, Legacy GT Limited, etc., --- but they can wait till after retirement!:) ",Posts: 85,Member

I am seriously considering an 06 Passat VE because it has everything I want out of the Passat with the exception of the lack alloy wheels and the OE brand of tires. The VE comes with Goodyear Eagle LS-2. On my (former) 04 Nissan Quest, the 99H version of these tires resulted in a buyback. Many other Quest owners have the same problem - I have been lucky to get out of my lease agreement. Here's my question: what is more cost effective? Paying the extra $2K for the 2.0T Standard Edition or getting the dealer to trade in the tires for Michelins and selling me 16"" alloys on a VE?

Well basically my choices are the following the Volvo S40 T5, 325Ci, A3, and IS 250.I've already test drove the 325 and S40, and when it comes to zip and gas mileage, i believe the S40 has it beat. Design and rep obviously goes to the BMW. I'll be going to test drive the A3 and IS 250 tomorrow morning. But i'm still a little torn. I'd appreciate the pros and cons of each and you're own personal preference. An objective opinion would be appreciated.As it stands right now, i'm leaning toward the S40 T5 with its power, mileage, and price.

we chose the S40 T5 over the 325 (price and to common), TSX (too common), (CTS (price) and 9-3 (scared of relaibility). We liked the S40 for its power, styling, economy and roominess relative to the size of car it is. For the money I think its the best deal. My personal opinion is that the BMW is too pricey, it's very difficult to find one on a dealer lot around 30-31k, same with the CTS. GM could have a winner here, but when we were shopping in August everything on the lot was 35k and up.We did have a fuel pump issue after we got the car, but the dealer (Volvo @ Gwinnett Place) was VERY good.

My thoughts are similar to Maddox'. I don't know your priorities, s I don't know whether your concerns are justified.W/r/t the IS - what will you use the backseat for? If you have kids, then it's an important concern. In fact, if you have kids who'll ride in back, you might want to look at the G35 or Acura TL (if you can live with the FWD). If you'll only use the rear seat for short trips and carrying a gallon of milk now & then, then it's not a real negative, right?As far as the memory option and manual steering wheel adjustments, if you will be the only driver, then this also shouldn't be an issue. My TL has manual steering wheel adjustments, and it's not an issue for me, even though my wife drives my car sometimes. ",Posts: 681,Member

I agree. See my post to a different forum: ""I did hours of research before diciding on Mazda3 hatch, based on total value. Drove 2 hours to a nearby big city for better selections. Test drove the car, but was not really impressed. Some poster said it right: it feels cheap. Cheap leather, cheap panel (buttons look like toys). The design probably is more suitable for teens (I am 58). And the engine needs more power. Anyway, back to the story... Since the same dealer also sells Audi A3, I decided to give it a try. One drive and I was hooked. This is more like a car for adults! I hired a taxi ($200 one way) to pick up my A3 several days later and have been loving it ever since. I know it's 10K more, but what the heck, life is too short! For the first time in my life I discovered that driviing could be so much fun."" ",Posts: 14,Member

I really like new Passat 3.6 4Motion for not only it is AWD but also it has a lot of luxurious features in the car. I just wish it has DSG, the best automatic in the world, then I think Passat is complete Configured it the way I want, the total with option comes to $38,924. Plus, VW has this new 3.9% finance on new model.For G35x, the total with option comes to $39,850 For M35x, it is about $10,000 more than Passat.However, as with any European car, the reliability is my concern. Checked the JDPower, and Passat never has a very good track record. I have driving nothing but Honda Accord so far, and I have not had any issue with it. I like Nissan, especially their engines I like new A3 (it has DSG) as well, but I think after I configure the way I want, total with option comes to around $34,391.I wonder if anyone can tell me their experience with VW and is it like BMW that is expensive to repair and replace parts after warranty is expired?Thank you very much ",Posts: 157,Member

I had a 2001.4 Passat and kept it for 4 years. I remember there being 1 serious issue, but it was covered under warranty, so I forget the details. Other than that, no problems whatsoever. No problems with gadgets not working, no squeaks or rattles, etc. It was a great car. Since 2001 or so, it's been a recommended pick of consumer reports, so I believe it's come a long way from the unreliable VW Rabbit days of yore.The new one sounds fantastic. It probably has a lot more body roll than either the M or the G, but it's probably just as luxurious as the M.I went from Passat to TL, and while I am happy, there are definitely cerain Passat features I miss.

Had an S40, was an okay ride. Hear the new one is based on the Mazda 3. Got wife an 06 Mazda 3 HB (basis for the V50) and she really likes it. It's better than my prior model S40 was. The S40 had a thumping kind of thing when you let off the throttle at a pretty good clip. (80-90MPH) Dealer said it didn't. Finally took sevice writer for a little ride. After that, the found it was caused by backpressure and nothing could be done. I'm probably too picky. I will say this though, with the old 1.9 turbo it hit at least 135MPH without too much sweat and had some of the best brakes I've ever used. ",Posts: 7,Member

How can you have 2 recalls on a brand new model in 5 months of purchase of car! Also, the passenger air bag deactivates here and there. In addition, the 100% maintenance is only covered at the dealership where the vehicle was purchased, so if you move or purchase the car at another dealership, you will not get the same lever of service and will have to pay out of pocket for some things (or get a smoked up Saturn Ion as your loaner!).

I'm looking to spend 30K or less on a sedan with some performance. I'm considering the Pontiac Grand Prix GXP which has received generally favorable reviews -- the torque of the V8 appeals to me and the current pricing is very attractive.I'm also considering the Altima SE-R. I've got price quotes on both vehicles in the high 26K's. I'd really like to have a manual transmission, and the SE-R I'm looking at is a 6 speed.

It really depends on what you want.

Again, it depends on what YOU are looking for. Both a great and economical. Both offer class-leading safety and great fuel economy.

The Accord will probably have a little more power and may be the better choice if you have any plans to carry friends, co-workers, or family around on regular basis. The Civic will probably be the sportier choice between the two. Take an extensive drive in both and pick what is best for you. ","Posts: 4,202",Member

I agree - it's a great time to be a buyer if you're interested in a sporty-family sedan in the $25-$30k range, especially if you're willing to take a year-used model.Ford, Buick, Infiniti, Acura, Honda, VW, Volvo, Subaru, and Mazda all make 4-door sedans that blend sportiness, comfort, practicality, luxury and price to various degrees. Deciding what your priorities are is the 1st step to narrowing the list.I'm biased against American cars, so I don't really keep up with them, but I'll give you my opinion on some imports:VW Passat & Jetta - they'll fit your bill if luxury becomes a determinative issueMazda6/Nissan Altima/Infiniti G35 - if sport is your top priority, check out these 2Honda Accord/Acura TSX/TL - more balance btn luxury and sportiness, with the Acuras also having some fo the best handling you'll find in a FWDVolvo S40T5 - a fun drive - A notch above the mazda in terms of interior ",Posts: 681,Member

The Jeep is especially competent in off-road situations and has that ""Jeep look""... a very American icon like a pair of Levi's. It can be had with the new Diesel engine if that is important to you. The Saturn is a Saturn - meaning that it is going to be a more anonymous-looking vehicle over time. It can be had with the Honda 3.5L engine, however! The Saturn will most likely have a decent Dealership experience and the Jeep could be hit or miss in that department.Are there any other choices you will consider? As stated earlier, the new RAV4 is a markedly improved version over last year's model and is similar in size to the Vue/Liberty. Of your choices, I would find the Liberty to have the superior build quality, but it would trail the new RAV4 in that department.My personal take...

Ross,There's a reason why SUV's and Minivans have been so popular with the family set. They work. There's just a lot more usable space in them than the old sedan style. Not that there's anything wrong with a Camry- it's a great car. But it's a sedan.Between the Odyssey and the new '06 Rav4- well, the Odyssey will be bigger- and more room is always better, as well as more utilitarian. The Rav4 has gotten stellar reviews so far- and will probably be more fun to drive. The Rav's hot V6 isn't going to be available until February or so. So- if you want a xmas present for your family, you've only got one choice. But- if you want the more thrifty 4cyl- you'll be able to get it in a couple weeks.From a style perspective- I'd vote for the new Rav4. But the Honda will make life the easiest. ",Posts: 384,Member

I think a minivan is the way to go, and don't discount the Toyotta Sienna. When my sone was born, we had a Honda Passport. By the time he was 1 mo old, we hated it! That was a truck-based SUV, so my wife had to lift my son and packages UP and into the car and UP and out of the car. Very strenuous for her. I think the RAV is car-based, so you won't have those problems, but you still can't compare the space of a minivan to an SUV.Picture this - it's an errand day. You, the wife and your children have already gone to a home decorating place like Bed Bath and Beyond, gone to an electronics store, picked up drycleaning and are now leaving the mall/Target/Costco with a full cartload.

I need to replace my '99 Accord LX-V6 coupe with 135,000 miles. I live in NH and commute 90 miles roundtrip to/from Boston for work. Due to my desire for a more stable ride during the winter months, I almost convinced myself to buy a Subaru Forester (or Outback). But I think I'll miss the interior comfort and performance of a Honda V6 engine. Both brands have their +'s and -'s and I'm now beginning to think I'll be happier with a new Accord (V6 with traction/stability control) with a set of winter tires. I've never driven a car with winter tires and 90% of my driving is on the highway so I can't give up too much dry/wet traction. According to the reviews on tirerack.com, the Dunlop M3, followed by the Blizzak LM25, is the highest rated ""performance"" winter tire. A new Accord V6 (leaning towards an EX, either coupe or sedan) with a set of winter tires will cost me about $4K more than a Subaru Forester (which comes with crappy Geolander all-seasons).

Although I'm now the proud owner of an '05 Acura TL, I was also very happy with two American-made vehicles (yes, I know, the Acura is American made too...but you all know what I mean):- Ford Taurus- Pontiac Grand PrixBoth were extremely reliable for me. I put on ~100,000 miles on both of them. My Mother-in-law is still driving my 2000 Taurus and it has about 120,000 miles and still runs like a champ. Although I never worked on my own cars the repair bills were generally reasonable when they did need minor repair (the Grand Prix literally never needed anything beyond routine maintenance; I think it's because GM has been making that same V-6 engine for so long). If I was forced to buy a four door vehicle for <$20,000 I'd look long and hard at those vehicles. Granted they don't make the Taurus any longer but you can find gently used ones for a heck of a deal.

Have you gone to test drive the new AccordV6 or the Subaru Forester? That will help you determine your final choice.I personally would have a difficult time as well due to the fact that Honda has perfected the traction for their cars as of 2003 and advances are installed with each new vehicle C/D notes. Hondas also - you have experience with their maintenance and expenses. Subarus - a few of my long time friends have Subarus, one living in the Colorado area says that its perfect for handling the dramatically different weather conditions, however it is more expensive in repair - which has only happened to him once for the AWD maintenance.I do have a question for you about your Honda - does the maintenance light go off at the scheduled times? and how is the cost of its maintenance?

Here's the situation: My wife and I both drive small economy cars with over 100,000 miles on them. They are running okay, but not great. We have kept them longer than either of us expected because I am in graduate school and have wanted to keep expenses down while I'm on loans. But I have promised her a new car when I graduate in six months, and given that we're going to be moving to a colder climate and doing a lot more driving probably in worse conditions (especially in the winter), I think we're both going to need a new one, and I'm not really sure where to start looking. I think I'm going to put a price limit of $20K on each of them, but perhaps the more important number is the monthly payment--I realistically don't want to spend more than $700 a month combined, and would like to spend less if possible. (Maybe I should lease?) I want sedans or coupes. No wagons, or SUVs, or trucks, or minivans. We would like something ""fun"" to drive, but I don't know how to define that. At the same time, reliability, durability, and total cost of ownership are VERY important. Probably the most important factors, actually. Given that, and past experience, I don't see myself buying anything domestic. I kind of like the looks of the new Ford Fusion, but I can't imagine buying the first generation of any American car (maybe I'm overreacting to that, though). I'm fine with only 4-cylinders. Front-wheel drive would probably be nice. So, I guess I'm thinking about a Civic or Accord, or a Camry (though I have always found them boring as hell), or a Mazda 3 or Mazda 6. But are there any other obvious contenders I should add to my comparison? My wife loves the Volvo S40 or the Acura TSX, but I don't think they're in our budget (even if I got less of a car than her, I don't see how we would swing either of those). Let me know if anyone can offer advice here. I feel like there are a zillion cars out there and I know about only a few, and maybe I'm missing a chance at a real bargain from another manufacturer.

I hope this helps! http://www.edmunds.com/apps/cto/CTOintroController2003 Honda Civic LX 4dr (approx. $12500 used & in great condition) (avg cost per mile - $0.33)- very reliable w/ good resale value, its engine doesn&#146;t have the pep that a Mazda will provide while keeping your gas mileage quite efficient. (Mazda&#146;s lineup has DOHC - dual overhead cam - which helps in the stepping on the pedal w/out killing your engine) &#150; Also, I don&#146;t know if you&#146;ve owned a Honda before, but the required maintenance is more frequent than other models. Maintenance is more expensive on them at times b/c the big stuff has to be done at the dealership - and if it isn't done by the dealership - best of luck - many places here in New Jersey won't touch a Honda&#146;s required maintenance.2002 Honda Accord LX 4dr (approx. $12000 used & in great condition) (avg cost per mile - $0.36)- incredible ratings - retains its resale value, good mpg w/reg maintenance (tires/oil) you can have a smooth running car up to 150,000. Remember that it&#146;s a Honda and maintenance that's required should be done at the dealership to maintain their warranty. I don't know if traction control is avail. w/ the 2002 Honda Accord. That&#146;s something you'll have to check into. I know the Traction Control and the EBD (electronic brake distribution) is a necessity with the weather conditions that occur.The Camry I haven't owned and can't comment on - however I've heard it's a good car if well maintained. I haven't heard any exciting remarks about them - mainly that they are good family cars.2002 Mazda 626 I have owned a newer Mazda and can tell you their cars are fun to drive while still avg&#146;ing 28-30 mpg for me. That&#146;s w/ 70% hwy - 30% city. It has approx. 85,000 miles on it, and has only required the tires and oil changed ... the transmission does shift a bit harder every now and then (its an auto trans) I&#146;d purchase another Mazda however it wouldn't be my 1st choice. Reason - I get the runaround at the dealership too often (and I&#146;ve taken it to a dealership in several diff cities).I know you didn&#146;t list it, however I would suggest to you the 2001 Buick Regal GS (approx. $8500 used - great condition) (avgs cost per mile - $0.35) It is a fantastic option, 27-29mpg using 93octane - Supercharged V6. My sister & her husband (in their 20s/30s) purchased a brand new one. They&#146;ve only changed the tires/oil since then - everything is perfect plus the auto trans shifts smooth as butter. They&#146;ve put over 90,000 on it. It hasn&#146;t required any major maintenance even at 4 yrs old. This Buick is listed as #1 for smartest sedan purchases (used car market). It also comes std w/ Traction Control & EBD Electronic Brake Distribution - the Buick has saved my sister & family a few times when driving in bad Jersey weather. (This Regal GS model automatically comes w/leather, heated seats, st.wheel controls, TC, EBD, dual zone air, and a ton more features)*also the insurance rates are lower on this car - dunno maybe b/c its more of a fam car? who knows. Best of luck in your car search!  ",Posts: 33,Member

I'd take a serious look at the Mazda3 and 6. The Mazda6 in particular is a lot of car for the money because they're being heavily discounted. The 3 is a helluva car (I just bought one, so I'm biased) but it's a lot of fun and I managed to get one for $16k new. My best friend has a Mazda6 (with V6) and it's a lot of fun, too.The Honda Civic is also a very good car, though not as much fun to drive or as sporty looking as the Mazdas.I agree with you that the Fusion is a great looking car and the reviewers have given it very high marks for handling/fun-to-drive factor. If you're not buying for six months or so, I'd think it would be a pretty safe bet. It would be almost a year into production and (one would hope) any major issues would be ironed out.Two more I'd consider, since you mention that a coupe is okay, would be the Scion tC. Another very good looking car with strong performance.The Nissan Altima is also a good deal and it's a great driving car with plenty of power even in 4-cylinder form. They can be had for $2500 to $3000 off sticker at the moment. Six months from now, they'll probably have even deeper discounts.Hope this helps. Good luck! ",Posts: 736,Member

But they still cost nearly as much as a Civic or Mazda3 and depreciate worse than any other Japanese car line.The Galant is a pretty good driver, too. I test drove a Galant GTS a while back, but it stickered for $27k! Even at the $22k they were offering it for, you could still buy a lot of Honda, Mazda or even (dull) Toyota. ",Posts: 736,Member

1. Try carsdirect.com2. In terms of mileage, I use 15,000 miles/year. So, any used car that is beyond 15,000 miles/year means you have more wear and tear on the car. In terms of the peak mileage, for Japanese cars, I go with 100,000 miles. However, for BMW, I go with even 300,000 miles. 3. If I understand you question right. Are you saying because the new cars depreciate most in first couple years, so the depreciation on the used car you purchased will not goes down as much as the new cars? I would say that is correct. In other words if you decide to sell your car, then you should not lose too much values in two years on the premises that the car is in good condition.4. I would only stay with Japanese cars for either used or pre-certified cars, meaning you should purchased from either Honda and Acura, or Toyota and Lexus only. Sorry, no Nissan and Infiniti.

If you are considering lease, and you have money, I would tell you to go for M5 and that is if you can even get one now  I played around the lease at BMW web site, and it came out to be around $2200/month. And, plus all the gas, I think it would be quite a lot for me that is I can see you like BMW more than MB. I like MB's interiors a lot better than BMW, and MB has better ride quality than BMW. I think you know all of it since you own a MB already. If I were you, I would go with 550i. 5 series is more livable considering you age and your financial situation. However, if you just want to get the ""race boy"" out your system, then I think you should get the Mazda MX-5.

I currently own a '98 Legacy GT, love it, and am considering a new one. However, I also like the Mazda 6. It's a great looking car. Aside from the fact that all Subies have all-wheel drive (not a big factor here in Texas), they seem somewhat comparable, though the Mazda strikes me as a bit sportier while the Legacy seems slightly more durable and crash-worthy.

Hope someone can help ... my wife is considering a Mazda3 for her next car, when her current lease on a Mitsubishi runs out soon. We took at look at a local Mazda dealership yesterday and were quite impressed.I looked at the crash test ratings on the IIHS site (as far as I'm concerned the NHTSA ratings are worthless) and found something possibly disturbing. A 2006 Mazda3 failed the crucially important side-impact test, however the tested vehicle was not equipped with optional side airbags. It goes without saying that any car we get will have them. Is there any way of knowing how much difference the side airbags will make? In other words, is it still likely that the Mazda3 will flunk the test even with them? ",Posts: 280,Member

January 2006 ",allfiredup,"
Most small cars WITHOUT side-impact airbags fail the IIHS side impact test. The Mazda3 with side-impact airbags hasn't been retested, but it is certain it will fare much better. The side airbags are standard on ""s Touring and Grand Touring"" models and optional on all others. I bought a Mazda3 about a month ago and the only test I could find of it with side airbags was the Australian ANCAP test. In that test, it scored a 14.17 out of 16 which they consider ""good"". Something else to consider, when the Chevy Cobalt and Toyota Corolla were tested without side airbags, they were rated ""poor"". Both scored ""acceptable"" when tested with the side airbags. Proof that they do make quite a difference. Hopefully they will re-test the Mazda3 equipped with them soon.The Mazda also did very well in the frontal crash tests. I guess the shared platform with Volvo pays off. ",Posts: 736,Member

Decisions, decisions, decisions. I have to lease a car with in the next several weeks and there are so many great cars.My lease for a BMW 330 convertible is up soon and I'm considering the 9-3 sedan, TL or IS250. I was pretty sure I was going to get the TL (409/month, 1500 total out of pocket) until I drove the Saab.The BMW 325 (570/month, 1500 T.O.P.) was not in consideration since you're basically paying for the name. Sure it might beat the others on a track but I have never driven on a track and probably never will.The IS250 would probably run around 450-475/month with 1500 T.O.P. but thats for a base car with 18 inch wheels. No luxury package or other options. No routine maintenance and tires will run around 1000$ before the lease is over. It's a nice car and quality throughout but again you're paying for the name and ""exclusivity.""The TL as everyone knows is a great car and offers value and dependability. It's probably larger than I need and gas mileage is not so great. Lots of standard equipment.The Saab suprisingly is a great car. After reading all the reviews about the car (Road and Track/Edmunds/Car and Driver), I was left with the perception that this was a crappy car....and it was made by GM. But I gave it a try this weekend since it was rated so highly on the crash tests. It was an awesome car and could be had for about 399 month (1500 t.o.p) fully loaded without navigation. They also have 3 year 36000 mile paid routine maintence. I also test drove the A4 2.0 (really nice interior but handles like a prius), A3 (great car, just no pretty in my opinion), RX-8 (too much sport and not enough safety), RL (sucks up too much gas and I don't need AWD in South Florida), and V50 (anemic).So I'm probably going to go with the 9-3.

You're right. The TL gets 20/29 MPG, which actually great for a 258 hp engine. The Saab has a slightly better mileage at 22/31 but that's for a much smaller engine (210 hp). When I test drove both cars however, the Saab seemed to accelerate just as quickly.I still haven't decided on the Saab. My common sense tells me to go for the Saab with the more reasonable price and safety. The headlights are sort of boring.My vanity tells me to go with the Lexus. And hey my kids are still really small and I can cram them in the miniscule back seats. I also like the idea of smiling everyday and saying to myself, ""Darn, this is a sexy car.""

I'm not sure if I would buy out my lease. It's a loaded 330 convertible with about 37000 miles on it.

I've already noticed problems with the top and the trunk doesn't open when the temperature drops below 60 degrees (??). It still drives pretty well but I'm not sure if it's worth the money. Plus when the warranty runs out I'm sure it's going to cost an arm and a leg to maintain the car.

Here are some random thoughts on the group of cars you mentioned:If you'll regularly transport adults in your backseat, downgrade the 325, A4 & IS - they're too small. On the other hand, if your backseat will go largely unused, those same vehicles will probably handle better than the others.The GS & Maxima are the least sporty of the group.The TL & G35 are close competitors. Those who choose the G35 usually cite the RWD as the reason for their choice. TL owners usually cite interior material differences. I drive a TL and am very happy with its reliability, handling, etc. It's navigation system is amazing - better than anything except maybe the Infiniti M34/45.Friends of mine have complained about the torque steer in the Maxima - my father drove both the Maxima and the TL (it has torque steer issues, too), and said the Maxima's torque steer ismuch more significant.Why do you care which car I think looks best?!?

I'm about 80% sold on the m3 but still have questions. The lady at the toyota dealership (if she can be believed) told me that the repairs on mazda's are more expensive than other cars...true or not? What's your experience. Also does the Toyota have a better resale value ( I tend to keep my cars for a while so this isn't a big deal) You seem to get alot more car with the M3...all disc brakes, lots of power features, more hp. Can any of you give me your opinion on this matter. There's about $2000 difference between the two, but I think that's justified with the Mazda just giving you more. What's your take?? Thanks for your comments! Heather T. ",Posts: 5,Member

I compared the same two cars! When I drove the Matrix/Vibe, I was very disappointed in the horsepower...or lack thereof. The car was inadequate when merging onto the highway here...although we are VERY aggresive drivers in New York State! I did like being ""higher up"" though in the Matrix...but the lack of power dissuaded me from buying.The M3 does offer you more...especially warranty...4/50,000 bumper to bumper for the Mazda and 3/36000 bumper to bumper for the Toyota with 5/60,000 for the powertrain. I'd rather the additional 14,000 miles bumper to bumper that covers everything than Toyota's extension for the powertrain. In essence, your gaining 14,000 miles bumper to bumper and only losing 10,000 for the powertrain with Mazda. That's a gamble I would personally take based on my current experience with my Mazda.From my personal experiences, my current Protege has been the cheapest car I've ever had to maintain. (I've owned a Buick, a Chevy and a Mitsubishi prior to this car) My service advisor is phenomenal and provides me with free rental cars for any/all service and always discounts the work to be done...for example my timing belt replacement was only $240 on my Protege BUT was over $600 in my Mitsubishi! (The above mentioned domestic cars were both money pits, so I ventured onto the ""other side"" and bought my first ""import"" when I bought the Mitsubishi. After 185,000 miles in four years, I had no complaints and no major repair work!)Hope my insights have helped. Keep us posted as to your decision.Garth ",Posts: 88,Member

What will the significant difference be between these two rides? What's the difference between Triptronic and DSG? ",Posts: 31,Member

January 2006 ",taxesquire,"
W/r/t your 2nd q. (tiptronic v. DSG), here is my understanding, based on a discussion in the VW Jetta forum:tiptronic is just a word (1 of many) to describe a feature that allows one to ""shift"" an automatic transmission. Tiptronic, automanual, whatever - it's all the same.DSG is a type of automatic transmission - actually, it's 2 transmissions in 1. 1 transmission has gears 1,3 & 5; another has 2,4 & 6 (don't know which one has ""reverse""). Anyway, the benefit of the DSG over other automanual arrangments is that there should be no lag time between gears. With most automanuals, you hit the button, paddle or move the gearshift, then there is a pause and then the gear engages. WIth true manuals, there is a slight pause while one engages and releases the clutch. With DSG, there shouldn't be any pause. ",Posts: 681,Member

""What's the difference between Triptronic and DSG?""Short answer - Night and DayLong answer - Tiptronic is a normal ""slushbox"" auto transmission with a slow acting override available for changing gears.DSG is an automated manual gearbox that has two clutches inside it on two different gear shafts, one with gears 1,3,5 and one with gears 2,4,6. This way the car can be in 1st AND 2nd at the same time (clutch is ""in"" on one and ""out"" on the other) so when changing gears it's just a matter of disengaging one clutch and engaging the other (handled by the cars computer). The result is near instantaneous gear shifts that can be done in fully automated mode, by the gearshift selector, or by the paddle shifters on the steering wheel. And you also get better gas mileage and faster acceleration than a regular manual. I have it. I love it. ",Posts: 32,Member

I am 29yo and will be starting a new job this summer where I can afford to trade in my 2002 Camry for a more luxurious and sporty car. I don't drive too aggressively, maybe because I've never had a car with much HP or RWD(previous cars were an old Civic and 1999 Corolla LE), so the fastest 0-60 time isn't important. Never learned how to drive a stick either. So when I started looking, I focused on the TSX, G35, 325i and IS250. Important features I looked for were a good nav system and bluetooth interface. What can I say, I love gadgets even such things as BMW's Idrive. Ride quality is still somewhat important to me, given what I've become accustomed to. At the very least, I'd like for a long trip on the highway to be comfortable. Then, I started thinking maybe I should consider a convertible/roadster like the TT, Z4, S2000, and MX-5 because I haven't started a family yet and perhaps should take advantage of that fact while I can. But, this car will still be my only vehicle to drive. My price ceiling is 35K +TTL.Anybody with experience driving or testing these cars have any suggestions? Anything I haven't looked at or should drop from the list? ",Posts: 31,Member

I don't drive too aggressivelyAll the cars you're mentioning are at their best when DRIVEN kinda hard. The TSX has to almost redline to experience all its beauty, and the 35 and 325 like to be pushed. If you're just gonna putt putt around....stick with the Camry.If you want a nice package with great power & features, and at a great price, the Acura TL will more than satisfy you. And the 4 doors are nice when the little ones start to appear. ",Posts: 905,Member

I've looked at the TL. Seems just like a bigger TSX but with more quality issues. The 2007 Camry has caught my eye, but I'd really like to get something isn't perceived as a family car. I thought the 2002 Camry was a nice change, but then everyone started getting it. About driving aggressively, it's kinda hard to and not too wise when my daily commute is through downtown Boston. I floor it for a couple secs and i'm already way past the speed limit. I'll be moving somewhere warmer this summer, so I might have more opportunity to open things up. ",Posts: 31,Member

""So you love it!, but highlight for what that means in terms of real performance. e.g. Passing on a two lane road, with traffic comming the opposite way 1/4 mile down."" Okay. Totally awesome here. With a stick you have to hit the right gear and then usually do a shift in the middle of the pass. With a slushbox, you hit the gas, wait for it to downshift, possibly downshift too far and then it pauses again as it upshifts and results in unpredictable acceleration. With DSG you just floor it and it nearly instantly pops down to the right gear and makes perfect shifts from there. You actually have to make sure you are not too close to the car in front of you so you don't launch your car into theirs.""passing and accelerating on a steep hill climb"" Pretty much same as above. A bit more so since the longer shift times of a stick or a slushbox hurt even more.""some other situation where the DSG showed its significant value?""Any sudden acceleration like the situations mentioned above are where it really shines. Do a test drive and cruise at around 40, then stomp the gas. You'll be amazed at how it downshifts, revs up, and takes off!. Faster than you can say ""never follow"". Plus, you've still got better gas mileage, if you can hold back on the gas pedal, which I find difficult. Also, you get the convenience of an automatic and the efficiency of a stick during normal driving. One last thing... The paddle shifters are just soooo cool!P.S. I've driven stick for almost 25 years and never wanted to drive anything else before I experienced the DSG. ",Posts: 32,Member

Well, I'm not the person purchasing the car, but I'm helping my father make the decision on a new sedan. His 99 Intrepid has been becoming increasingly troublesome, and it's becoming prohibitively expensive to keep it, especially considering it's trade-in value.Okay, second of all, I don't know all that much about cars. I figured this would be a great place to hear what people who know what they're talking about have to say about this.He's looking for a pre-owned vehical, not too expensive. (Aprox. 20k is his limit.) The main consideration for the decision is long-term reliability and safety. He has to make relatively regular trips between Southern Virginia and Southern North Carolina, a journey of about 700 miles. This car will be getting A LOT of miles, relatively quickly. This is also a stretch of road that can be very busy, and the likelyhood for accidents seems fairly high. So, safety and reliability are the two primary concerns, to the exclusion of nearly all others (Besides price.).So far, we've been looking at pretty much any of the Toyota sedans, which look to be extremely reliable and relatively safe. However, he's also been considering a Volvo. Now, I know Volvo's have a reputation for being very safe and reliable, but I have heard that in recent years they have been doing very little to justify that reputation, and they are very expensive. I'm thinking if he pays the high cost of a Volvo, he'll be paying for the name and the import costs and not excellent reliability and safety.The Mitsubishi Galant also seems to be both reliable and safe, but I'm really not positive. If anybody has any suggestions based on this, that would be wonderful. Any help would be appreciated! ",Posts: 1,Member

Ok, this Malibu Maxx driver, who likes the Maxx but is worried his first year build model is gonna offer real trouble, is considering the following:1. Malibu Maxx SS ('06 model)2. Audi A3 3.2T QUATTRO3. Toyota RAV4 ('06 model)My biggest concern is overall reliability and dealer backing. The Audi has advantage of AWD and a nice interior but costs way more than the other two, and I really don't know if it will be reliable (Audi, and especially its parent BMW, do poorly on that) or if its resale will hold up.The Maxx SS, has a more advanced engine than my LS, is a known quanity and should have its 1st year gremlins out by now, but I hear the ride is like lead and am not 100% sure the VVT engine reliability (how are other GM engines with VVT holding up?).Perhaps the Toyota is the safest choice given their track record.

I'm considering the volvo s40 T5 (can't decide if I need the AWD or not) and other competitors to it... like maybe the Saab 9-3 2.0T, possibly the Passat (maybe no AWD to go cheaper?), Audi A4 (maaaybe.. probably more expensive well equipped), maybe the subaru Legacy. I'd like to stay near (or under) the $30-32k mark, leather (or a good synthetic? don't like cloth) would be nice, can't decide if I want the AWD, Auto w/ manual mode (I'd like to hear if anyone has experience with the difference in the ""manual"" mode for these vehicles?), fun to drive.I read about people having problems with the s40 so I'm a little concerned with quality there, but then again, shouldn't the Volvo be one of the best? My family has had lots of problems with VW so I'm very leery there too. We just bought a Tribute and love it, but I'm not sure the Mazda 6 has the same interior luxury/build quality of the Volvo? I'm also concerned the s40 may be a little small in the back (even though I like small) since it's built on the same platform as the Mazda 3.It'll be a while before I buy, so I could be looking at '07s if there are rumors of any big changes for these vehicles.

Hi! I'd love to help you! OK, so you want safety, reliability, good car at about $20,000. Volvo is safe, but not reliable. I have a friend who owned many volvo's, they all weren't reliable. Read CONSUMER REPORTS if you want proof on that. Volvo is Ford. Mitsubishi, is never praised for making great cars. Quality is average for Mitsubishi. The best cars are Honda's and Toyota's. I've owned Toyota's all my life, they never, ever break. The best thing would be to actually BUY a current camry. There is a new Camry coming out in a few months, so you will get a cheap price for the one out now. You can get a good new car for 24,000. The camry might be around 21-24, depending on features. The Honda accord is also something to consider - reliable, safe, affordable. Again, for two or three thousand dollars more you get a new car.I hope this is helpful. If you have any more questions, I will gladly reply. Also, please narrow down to specifically what type of size car you want if you would like more information, and my opinion.

If the #1 characteristic you want this car to have is ""reliability"" forget any European car.If you can spring for a new car with a new car warranty from somewhere other than Europe (and frankly probably the US, too), all the positive buzz in terms of your personal risk seems to suggest a certain car manufacturer originally making all their cars in Korea, now making some in the US, but all offering a 100,000 mile or 10 year warranty. You probably figured: Hyundai is the company to mitigate risk ($$$$) -- moreover, they are often available for really surprising money, even brand new.One of the guys I work with had a 2004 ""baby Jaguar"" looking Hyundai, V6, sunroof, nice sound system decent interior -- the car rode great, decent back seat and with the V6 engine was pretty peppy.I'd say it was a bit bigger than an Audi A4 and, like I said didn't seem to be cheap, but he got it for around $17K ""nicely equipped"" as the saying goes.I drove the S40 T5 AWD -- and I thought it was a very nice ""discount"" Audi S4.There are quite a few Subarus that might do also, but the price point may be less attractive than a brand new 2006 Hyundai.Hope this provides some food for thought.Were I you, I would research this here and elsewhere on the Internet and then I would go drive some cars.Note: difficult or awkward as it may be, test drive your short list more than once and if you test drive car ""A"" on a specific mixed route (of secondary streets, primary and secondary roads and Interstates), make certain you test drive the other cars on the SAME circuit.If you drive car A on Rt 32 and car B on Rt 119, one of these cars will be at a disadvantage for this, that and the other reason.I took a test drive with a salesperson with me (something I rarely do) and let her tell me which route to follow -- and sure enough if she didn't direct me on the route that had ""perfect"" road surfaces and ideally banked corners and curves and was as smooth as glass yielding the quiet-est ride. Now that was a revealing test drive! :P Test your Volvo, VW and yes your Hyundai over the same, exact same route -- very revealing.Also, if you, as I do, test the sound system, I bring my own CD and always use the same one in each test drive.On the other hand, if you would never consider a Hyundai, don't waste your or the salesperson's time. If you must have a European car despite the comments here about reliability, etc, forget Honda and Toyota too.If you're feeling particularly rich, test the new ""high zoot"" Hyundai Azera -- I saw it at the Auto Show and it is pretty impressive for $27K nicely equipped.Just some thoughts.

No, I mean I wouldn't weigh anything they say as more than a footnote.I don't care if they love or hate the Subaru or any other car -- I simply believe (and this may be unique and totally personal, kinda like Common Sense -- which is ONLY Common to ONE person) that cars are perchased significantly for emotional, right brain reasons. All of us attempt to rationalize these purchases.Now it is true that some folks, and I only know of ONE for certain, care not what the car looks like and beyond a certain basic minimum, don't care much about amenities, ride, handling or fit and finish unless the lack or inclusion thereof materially influences reliability and cost. Progressively this person gets ever less expensive and, to my tastes, stripped down unappealing cars. He does always get new ones and he does not abuse them.He simply eschews all the right brain trappings.Now he has never had one of those really hideous Pontiac Aztechs or whatever they were called, but that, I am certain, has more to do with their quality and reliability and durability (in some combination) than looks, performance, sound system, power accessories, cruise control, etc. He could care less if the car is, and I choose this carefully, hideous looking. He is aware, or so it seems, of his cars perceived (by others including his wife, children and the larger society's) pulchritude.If the most beautiful car in the world met his criteria, I think he would go with that.The rest of us buy out of a huge dose of passion.CR does little to talk to that part of most folks, IMHO.

CR does respect and praise cars with good handling and performance (many of their bests match what Car and Driver picks!). But they also look at practical aspects to balance things out, which are of less importance to a car enthusasist.Take an Audi A3 Quattro or a Lotis Elise. Pros: Excellent drive train, Fine handling, nice (Audi) interior, tons of image. Cons: burns premium gas, hard ride, weak reliability, few dealers to get service at, costs a bundle. Right brainers love those cars. CU, which had good things to say about them, takes a more balanced look.Perhaps the 2 cents here is research, try, buy, and enjoy! ","Posts: 1,798",Member

Just a thought - find out how much an extended warranty for each car will cost - this will tell you two things. If the MB warranty is $3,500 and the BMW's is $2,900 (made up numbers) then the expected cost of repairs on the MB must be higher. Even if you do not buy the warranty (I never do) it gives you some idea what to expect in future repair costs - although the actual could be zero or MUCH higher. I would also - give both BMW & MB service a call and ask them how much they charge to replace some common part - like a starter - or alternator - this will scare the heck out of you and you will decide to buy a different car.

Thanks for the reply. This will confuse things more.The MB comes with a 5yr/50,000 mile warranty, bumper-to-bumper.

Both are after-market warranties and two different companies, two different dealerships.I will definitely call about a replacement part.I do know that here in CT.

I overwhelmingly prefer German cars. Of the two cars you have specified, my preference is further strengthened by virtue of the fact that I am biased in favor of All Wheels Driven on a scale of 1 - 10 at an 11.Having said all of these things, however, the only reason that either of these German cars might SEEM to retain their value is that they have probably depreciated substantially already, so the relative reduction of value in absolute terms will be, on a go forward basis, low, or ""low-er"" than perhaps it would be were the cars in question current MY and new vehicles.Having said this, it is my belief that leasing either a 2006 BMW or Mercedes AWD vehicle will quite possibly cost less than paying the breathtakingly expensive costs to keep either of these German beauties running.And, despite my bias for AWD, my second preference remains FWD and the Hyundai will have a bigger and longer safety blanket with its warranty and I would suspect will not be any worse than the BMW or Mercedes in terms of loss in value especially when coupled with what will certainly be your out-of-pocket costs to keep the Germans running.If you want something that will probably retain its value for years to come, well, it isn't going to be a car unless it is a collector's item or exotic.These two vehicles that you have chosen will, I can imagine, become breathtakingly expensive to own in less than two years.I don't have enough money to afford a 3 year old car is kind of the point, especially with BMW's (for instance) 100% free maintenance and heavily heavily subvented lease programs.There are many factors that may make my conclusions less valid and perhaps completely invalid for your situation. I would encourage you to consider the maintenance and repair expenses on either of these 2003 models plus the acquisition and money costs (if any) before I pulled the trigger on two cars that may be less than ""admirably"" reliable.Just a thought, or two. . . .

Or used, something 2-3 years old, a BMW or Lexus. I know these choices are all over the place, but my main criteria is price point, about $25-30K and reliability. I see from your earlier posts, that if reliablilty is a persons main want, that you wouldn't recommend European. Do you think the reliability issue would be that big?

You are comparing vehicles of different categories and completly different cars. Bmw, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, used not used - try to be more specific with what category. Hyundai's do not have good quality, and used cars are not the best for quality too, but can be good. My best suggestion would be a new Civc. It has many safety features and Day-time running lights so your insurance will also be cheaper. A camry is a great car, but that is a different category. I would narrow it down to Honda Civic, and Camry.Also, think about a used Accord ",Posts: 340,Member

From my experience, you don't want an old sports car (or anything even remotely sporty). You don't know how the previous driver(s) handled it, and a lot of issues might come up later that won't necessarily be caught if you have a mechanic look over it before you buy it. The same is true for any car, but people are particularly hard on sports cars. That being said, I wouldn't suggest a 5 yeard old BMW. I also wouldn't buy a Sonata. Yes, they have long warranties. But you're going to need to use it - OFTEN.Stick with something more reliable.I have a 2002 VW Passat, and I test drove an '05 Camry. NOT a good transition. The Camry felt too big and sluggish compared to the Passat. The Civic seems small in comparison. If I were you, I'd wait and get an '04 Acura TSX. It's slightly smaller than the VW Passat, has more power, and looks sleek. Overall, try not to get anything more than a couple of years old, and with low miles. That way, you'll get a considerable discount (versus a new car), and it shouldn't have too much wear and tear. ",Posts: 16,Member

You just told this guy to NOT buy an old sports car, but then told him to buy an old sports car - the 04 TSX. How do you know how that car was treated? A TSX is engineered to perform at the redline of the tach. That's plenty of potential wear and tear. Get a new TSX. ",Posts: 172,Member

Let me clarify: When I say ""old,"" I'm talking about anything with more than 2 years of driving on it, i.e. a 5 year old BMW. I didn't say not to buy a used car. A car that's one or two years old with low miles, from my experience, can be checked out sufficiently to know if there's anything wrong with it. I've never had any problems with cars that I purchased that were 1 or 2 years old. I also check to see WHEN they were first purchased (i.e. if it's an '04 but it was first purchased at the end of 2004, it would have less than 1 1/2 years of driving on it, vs. an '04 that was purchased at the end of '03 and therefore has 2 1/2 years of driving).

..is to consider only certified cars (Audi, BMW and VW have good inspection programs), or to get the vehicle from CARMAX (which does good job offering vehicle records and is pretty selective about what they well).I'd definitely stay away from any first year sports car (even if the spiel is ""but it's been in (wherever) for 3 years before it came here"". There are bugs anyway, and even Toyota and Lexus, kings of reliability, have to find and fix first year model glitches! Give the manufacturer a year to fine tune their USA verison.

The Passat and Camry were both 4 cyl. The size and handling were the main differences I noticed between the two; everything else seemed minor in comparison to those issues. The Camry has a very smooth ride, it was just too boring to drive. The Passat (as I'm sure you've realized) is a balance between a family car and a ""fun car"" - more power, more fun to drive, tiptronic engine, comfortable amount of space, etc. The TSX is a step up from the Passat, and from what you said in your original post, it sounds like you would probably like the TSX. It's kind of a combination of all the cars you listed - the reliability of the Camry and the Civic, the sportiness of a BMW, the (approximate) size of your Passat, etc. You should check out the TSX forums on this site. As far as comfort vs. agility, I think the TSX offers a good balance for a reasonable price. It actually has more front legroom than the &#145;04 Camry and the &#146;00 Passat (less head room, though). You would need to test drive it to see, though. For me, it would be an easy transition from a Passat because of the increased agility and reliability without a sacrifice in comfort. As far as the Mazda3 is concerned, I have never test- driven one. I can tell you what the stats are, but test driving a car makes a big difference.As far as new vs used TSX, it&#146;s just a matter of preference. I tend to buy cars 2 years old because of depreciation in those first two years. I paid $9,000 less for my Passat by buying it 2 years old, and I only had to pay $500 for cv boots, which gives me an $8,500 savings. If you want to pay several thousand extra for a brand new car to possibly save money in car repairs, then by all means, go ahead. It just seems that buying one a year or two old with low miles gives you the cost savings AND you still have the reliability factor.Not sure if it's ""okay"" to say this, but you can go to www.carsdirect.com for really good comparison info (new and used cars) :blush: .If you put in the years of the cars you're looking for, it will pull up a side by side comparison of pretty much everything. I'm sure Edmunds has it too, I just haven't looked for it on this site. ",Posts: 16,Member

Well I drive a Malibu Maxx LS which is based on an Opel/Saab design. The SS's the sporty model but rides like an old truck and guzzles gas (Chevy seems slow to comprehend ""touring""). Also, the Maxx is at best average in reliability (the Mailbu sedan is much worse).I wanted a hatchback which disqualified Accord and the Camry. The Toyota RAVE4 sounds very promising. Am also considering an Audi A3 but given poor dealer service hours in my area, have to find out first if it's bucked the Euro reliability curse.The euro brands usually offer better handling and (for VW / Audi) a nicer interior. But so far their reliability isn't all that good (JD POWER and Consumers Union). Then again, if you have a great Euro dealer and get a ""good one"", that can make a lot of difference.

My wife wanted a TSX - for the last year - every time we saw one she would say - look a TSX - I want one!So we went to Acura for a test drive. Ride is not that great - about the same as a 2006 HONDA CIVIC - which is not bad in a $14,000 ECONO BOX - but if you are paying $25 - $29K then you should expect a MUCH BETTER RIDE. The handling is the major downfall of the TSX - I will be kind - it is a JOKE - the Civic has better steering control. I will say the TSX does have more power than the Civic - so mark that down as the only advantage - you can always add leather so I will not count that!The 2006 TSX is a 2002 European Honda Accord - and it lives up to that high standard. Not bad for a 2002 econo car - but a complete waste if you want a 2006 sport sedan. But wait - if you really want a front wheel drive ""sport sedan"" with a 4 banger that needs premium gas - it would be a good choice. ","Posts: 1,986",Member

Thx 4 ur inputs so far. Since u folks have been helpful so far, a little bit more info.History: I started this search since my current lease on my Mazda 6s was coming to an end. Great car, but lacked the memory seating and it had a tremendous amount of road noise. Hence having phone conversations while on the road was difficult. (My work revolves around the phone & email.). Plus we wanted to share the car so that we'll reduce the use of our gas guzzler - Ford Expedition.So we started our search with this:a) Memory Seatingb) Road noise should be lowc) Should be a Japanese card) Should have the *most* value for moneyThe rest of it relating to telescoping wheel, nav, etc ... were creature comforts that we are not set on. But at this price point, they 'all' come with some or all of it.On evaluating several cars (ES, GS, TL, Accord, Maxima, TSX, G35), we found out that we needed to spend in the $30s. Used or not, there was a delta of about $3K from the $30K number. We were comfortable with that. Hence the search ....Now to answer your Qs:I live in Portland, OR. Anticipated annual mileage will be around 8K miles. Push comes to shove maybe 10K.The car will be driven on alternate days by my wife & me. (I'm trying to wean her away from her favorite - Ford Expedition due to gas reasons.) Hence the telescoping feature will be as important as the memory seating if I'm going to pay the $30sK price tag.We test drove the ES and it did not suit me at all. Too bland. Did not have the 'tiptronic' feature. Spouse liked the steering; as good as the GS300. (We may still end up getting the ES since there are good deals on some used ones here; but leaving it as the last of the last option.)VW Phateon: None around here and it is still priced well above my price point across the country.I'll be paying cash. If to sweeten the deal, the dealer wants me to get a loan, I will; and then in a month I'll turn around & pay it off completely. (I did this with my bike so that they dealer could reduce the price of the bike by $500/-. Cost of the loan: $50/-)The car is going to be a 'lifer' (yeah right!!!) and I may consider selling it in 5 years. But not before that, for now. I don't want a lease, since my current Mazda 6s is one and spouse wants to know where the money went. :mad: I would buy this car and keep it, but it does not have the memory seating - that is the key feature that I'm looking for. All the rest are creature comforts that I can live without, but have added into the equation due to the price tag.So hopefully this gives u little more insight that u can base your inputs on.Once again thx for ur inputs.

MemoRe: Shopping for a new car.Date: NowThere is a saying that goes something like this:ü	Do not advise your boss, employees, friends, neighbors or relatives on virtually anything pertaining to &#147;substantial&#148; decisions (such as car buying, house buying, major purchases of almost any nature &#150; even home appliances and TV's that are over several hundreds of dollars); for, if your advice is followed and that advice turns out to have any negative consequences, the person you advised may have &#147;difficulties&#148; with the relationship between you two in the future.Having said this and pretty much believing that it is true, I will submit the following not as advice(since I don't want to make even my blogger friends have difficulties) but as data points and/or information for your to consider as you make your moves with respect to a new vehicle.==========ü	In an ideal world, something that &#147;costs&#148; or is priced at &#147;X&#148; should &#147;cost&#148; very close to the same as something that is also priced at &#147;X&#148; &#150; since the dollars are the great equalizer. A $30,000 Ford should ""cost"" [you] about the same as a $30,000 Chrysler, that is. It almost makes too much sense doesn't it?In the ""real world,"" however, this is true only sometimes. It is rarely true with Cars and Major Appliances, to name two, however.What I mean by this is that a $30,000 car may be acquired, for instance, for $30,000 in cash, financed @ 0.00% interest for 60 months with a payment of $500 per month, leased for 39 months for $219 per month or financed with stated interest rates (above 0.00%) for a specified number of months.Moreover, a $30,000 car when it is first brought to market (and/or if it is VERY popular) may command its full MSRP, or OVER its full MSRP or sometimes even under its MSRP. Yet 8 months or a year later, for example, it may be discounted (off of MSRP to effect a drastic price cut per month) to ""$179 per month with $999 due at signing,"" when it has been upstaged by a newer &#147;hot car.&#148; Of course, it is the same car as it was 8+ months ago, but now it is ""worth less"" to the consumer even though it is the same car ""now"" as it was ""then."" The lesson learned?: the market is fickle. Doh! Do ya think?Your willingness and ability to ""time"" (or plan) your purchase so that you can order the exact car you want may benefit you. On the other hand, your willingness to &#147;take what is available&#148; NOW may benefit you, too. Your ""refusal"" to take a black leather interior in favor of a gray fabric interior could actually cost you MORE money despite the fact that the MSRP of the car sporting leather seats is probably higher. Why? Well, it is because the price is, in large measure, based on ""what is hot TODAY."" The Acutal Cost of Manufacture seems almost irrelevant when it gets to the retail level under certain circumstances.Other factors, you can control will affect your deal, too. Namely, your willingness to take either a Ford, Mercury, Saab, Nissan, Toyota, Subaru, Dodge, VW, BMW or Hyundai product may get you substantially ""more car"" (your definition is the one that determines what is ""more"" not anyone else's) for the same or LESS money than if you are steadfast that ONLY a day-glow purple metallic Nissan Pathfinder WITHOUT a sunroof and with Premium Stereo but with fancy alloy wheels and without Homelink but equipped with XM Radio, and so on, is worth your consideration.Personal ExampleAlthough I have had over 2 dozen Audis since early 1977 (and by that I mean my cars, my wife&#146;s cars and company cars during that period), the last time I looked at getting a new car, I shopped for about 10 cars and narrowed it to 3 and short listed it to 2.At the time, the car with THE HIGHEST MSRP was almost $200 per month less than a car that was over $3,000 lower MSRP (on a lease of 36 months or 39 months with 15,000 miles per year allowance.) The car with the most ""features and functions"" was nearly $6,000 less than the one with the highest MSRP, but it &#150; the one that was $6,000 less &#150; took 120 days to get, and the monthly payment was almost the same as the $6,000 more expensive car and the term was only 3 months longer on the lower priced car to make it competitively priced with the most expensive car.Whew! It was confusing and tiring just to wade through all the data points.As noted, I looked at 10 cars that were roughly in the same ""size and content area"" in March of 2005 &#150; this ""area"" included an Acura RL, Chrysler 300C AWD, a Cadillac CTS and STS AWD, an Infiniti M35X, a BMW 530i, an Audi A6 quattro, a Mercedes E class 4Matic and several others. The cars I initially considered ranged in MSRP from $40,000 to over $56,000.I ""wanted"" the Audi (it was my sentimental favorite) &#150; but only if it could be had at the right price. It was NOT the least expensive @MSRP, but it was the ""middle child"" between the initial final three: Audi A6 3.2, BMW 530i, and Infiniti M35X. At this point, the lowest monthly payment was associated with the BMW, which had the highest MSRP!All-wheel-drive (AWD) was a deal breaker, however, as I would NOT, under any circumstances have a two wheel drive vehicle (especially NOT RWD) &#150; FWIW, my own and my family&#146;s safety and security are too important to compromise on that. Besides I actually am convinced that AWD cars perform better and are more fun, too boot. At that time, only the Audi and the Infiniti offered AWD.But, I priced all three vehicles to use in my negotiations (and in an attempt to keep his car in the game, the BMW dealer assured me there would be a new AWD BMW &#147;soon&#148;) &#150; and I shared the information with the dealers I spoke to. I kept them each fully in the loop of the prices that were being offered for cars that were &#147;VERY similar&#148; in content.First the easy stuff (for me):ü	I determined 3 color choices were what I was looking for. Color Choice #1 Green, #2 Silver and #3 Red or Dark Blue &#150; any of these three colors were workable (remember I was planning to order the car, so to clarify, please understand that my number 1 choice was dark green pearl and number two was silver pearl, number three was a dark red pearl or a dark blue pearl &#150; tied, in that order.) I discovered Infiniti did not offer a green, but it did offer silver. I was now down to two color choices, then and both were acceptable to me.ü	Interior Color Choice and covering (fabric, leather, [alcantara] or plastic) &#150; here, too, I had in my mind three colors or combinations that I would accept with the exterior color choice I wanted. My choices included &#150; Camel Leather, Beige Leather or Platinum/gray Leather or Alacantara. These three colors would work with green or silver pearl paint so I ranked them in the order I specified above.I then moved on to the ""optional"" or ""available"" content, the things most of us know as options and packages.Go to Next Post ","Posts: 5,343",Member

Option Packages (considerations):#1 must have#2 must NOT have#3 OK to haveIndividual options (considerations):#1 must have#2 must NOT have#3 OK to haveI also wanted to consider some other factors that would be important. Broadly I put them under the rubric Total Cost of Ownership (TCO.)Cost structure (assuming 50,000 miles):1.	Insurance costs2.	Maintenance costs3.	Fuel costs4.	Repair costs (which implied warranty coverage considerations)5.	Tire replacement likelihood (will I need tires in the period of time I plan to have it?) and costsAnd, of course ""professional"" input, was important to me, too. I read a lot of test reports and reviews.Reviews from everywhere EXCLUDING Consumer&#146;s Reports (for I do not buy their rankings), but including:ü	Automobileü	Car & Driverü	Motor Trendü	Road & Trackü	New York Timesü	USA Todayü	On-line blogs, e.g., edmunds.com & the Internet generallyAs noted, there would be linkage between the product features, style and ""content,"" and the acquisition and on-going costs. I consdidered many other factors, that is.Finance and/or Lease terms/payment options, other factors to consider, etc:ü	Seat of the pants driving feel (subjective)ü	Availability, convenience and requirements related to service and service intervalsü	Regrets from previous purchases &#150; &#147;I wish I would have gotten cruise control, etc.&#148; kind of thing (I now LOVE satellite radio, for example)The shopping research allows the subsequent efforts.Shopping Pre-work:ü	Identical test drives: this is difficult and time consuming to accomplish, but it is very important.o	Take multiple test drives of car &#147;A&#148; &#150; if possible make two visits to the dealership and test drive different examples of car &#147;A&#148; OVER THE SAME ROUTE.ü	Take notes. Figure out what impressions you have and write them down. Note questions that you want the cars under your scrutiny to addresseso	Take multiple test drives of car &#147;B&#148; &#150; if possible make two visits to the dealership and test drive different examples of car &#147;B&#148; over the same route that you took car &#147;A&#148; &#150; yes, this means if the dealerships are 10 miles apart, you must decide where the test drive loop/route is and be faithful to it with all the cars you test.Remember, a car that seems silky smooth on the Interstate may seem uncertain and/or rough on a secondary road or urban street setting. Three hard stops in a row can reveal brakes that seem great on the first stop or two may &#147;fade&#148; on the third stop, etc. Deal du jour considerations:Somebody, somewhere has a ""good-deal"" going on at any one time. The deal you are offered on day 1 may be better or worse on day 31 or 61. You will drive yourself NUTS if you always believe &#147;it will be better tomorrow.&#148; It may indeed be better tomorrow &#150; but what may be better may be on your #2 choice in your #3 choice of color and interior. You have to determine HOW much (in dollars) something is worth today and in the future.For example, if you want a red car and one exactly like you want in every other way is offered to you in white (or some other color that is NOT red), you have to determine how much RED is really worth to you as a portion of the deal, as a percentage of the MSRP. If the white car is $1,000 less will you pay the $1,000 to get the red one? Your values count here, not the salesperson's and certainly not mine.Of course if you are ordering a car, this will be a much more minor issue, but, remember, in my case, I wanted the color ""pearl green"" and Audi and BMW offered this color while Infiniti did not. On the BMW, in fact, pearl green was a $750 option. It was &#147;no extra charge&#148; on the Audi and silver was &#147;free on either the Audi or the Infiniti&#148; but silver was also $750 on the BMW.What&#146;s &#147;that special something (option, color, etc.) worth to you?&#148; Unless you ONLY have one color and/or combination in mind, you could save yourself money by having a choice #2. Somewhere I believe there is a study that links the car's color to the owners overall happiness with the ownership experience. The lesson there is if color is important to you, $750 less will be meaningless to you 6 months from now as you are driving the one you ""settled for"" while seeing the color you really want driving down the street.==========Enough about colors.For me, my #1 &#147;I wish it could come with&#148; option was a stick shift. Only the BMW offered either manual or automatic shift. Manual shift was $1,275 LESS than automatic &#150; plus the gas mileage was +2MPG better. But I was not unwilling to drive an automatic if I had to.Other important (to me) accessories, options, features or content (whatever ""name"" they call it is by manufacturer) included keyless entry, push-button start and rear parking radar, for example.Audi and BMW offered rear parking radar; Infiniti offered a rear camera which mostly was a substitute for the radar. Audi and Infiniti offered push-button start; it was standard on the Infiniti, it was $750 on the Audi, and not even offered on the BMW at that time.The list of ""must have"" things, including anti-lock brakes, all-season tires and so on was quite extensive in my case. To keep things straights, I had to make them fit into categories:ü	Must have (e.g., All Wheel Drive)ü	Must NOT have (e.g., a solar sunroof)ü	Nice to have even if it costs a ""little more"" (another subjective term) (e.g., a power rear window shade)ü	OK to have (but not really worth much with respect to $ to me, or something that probably I would never order but that would not make me reject the car simply because it came with this feature) (e.g., cooled seats)In my case, as a further example, tire pressure monitoring over a three year period has fallen from Must have to Nice to have to OK to have since I had owned a car with it for almost 3 years and found it novel (and not lacking in some potential) but not particularly useful, either. Likewise, I had evaluated On*Star for 3 years and decided it was not worth $16.95 per month for &#147;the basic&#148; system. The higher priced systems were outrageously priced, so there, too, I was not interested.Now, Satellite Radio, on the other hand, has gone from Nice to have to Must have, as has voice command and sat nav.Note: My examples are just that, MINE &#150; but I submit you may want to consider setting up your own criteria and then living with them. You may change your mind over time, but you will drive yourself nuts and harbor post purchase doubts if you don&#146;t understand your current Must&#146;s, Must not&#146;s, Nice&#146;s and OK&#146;s fully.

Summary/Examples:""Switching gears"" to make a point, i.e.The SUV from Lincoln/Mercury called the Mercury Mariner is, by all accounts a good vehicle. It may be NOT what you want, however. Yet, is there a price at which you might consider the Mariner over another vehicle you are currently favoring? If the two vehicles can be similarly equipped, &#147;how much&#148; are they on identical termed deals? At what point can the Mariner ""make you an offer you can't refuse?""Currently, the Mariner for 39 months with $0.00 due on the day you pick it up (that is no down payment, no deposit and no first payment) is $279 per month and that allows 12,000 miles per year.If you have not tested the Mariner, simply as an example, does the $279 per month with no up-front $&#146;s sound in any way &#147;interesting?&#148; Mariner has been named a &#147;best buy,&#148; if you are impressed by such information, here's the URL: KlikComparably equipped, what is the deal (even if you are NOT interested in leasing) on cars on your current short list and the Mariner? This may be very revealing about you or the intended buyers/drivers.By the way, I want you to know I am NOT endorsing or suggesting that you stay away from or gravitate to any particular vehicle (other than all wheel drive from whoever you choose.) I am suggesting that you consider putting things into $ perspective. If you would take the Mariner for $100.00 per month but not for $600.00 per month, now you know what your ""bookends"" are. You need simply begin discounting the $600.00 down to the point that you WOULD be unable to refuse the Mariner and unless that is unrealistically, low, say $110.00 per month, you then would know better how to evaluate the market. If the Mariner is a complete mystery to you, for instance, perhaps a long test drive does have merit, before you move either closer or farther from making such a decision.And, so you do not think this tangent is a hidden Mercury advert:Have you considered a Hyundai product? The market buzz is very high on them and they are very well warranted and the newest ones can be decked out with &#147;lots of content.&#148; They are no longer ""cheapies,"" i.e. What about Ford, Dodge, GMC? Do these nameplates interest you at all? How about Honda, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi or Subaru? Right now Subaru, e.g., is riding HIGH on a great reputation with very sound, and most consider, ""attractive"" products.Perhaps you would never consider a Saab, or hadn&#146;t thought about one previously &#150; but, perhaps General Motors current woes can be your good fortune. The SAAB 97-X is, by all accounts, a pretty good SUV, sporty and very car-like; and, it is heavily &#147;supported&#148; (financially) by GM.

wrt preceding posts, very interesting.Only thing I can add is... buy or lease?Leasing seems a plus for those not driving many miles (Audi allows 12K/Yr max), and for cars with long warranties, but very high part and service expenses once the warranty has expired.In this case the lease might be structured to only span the warranty period, at the end of which the leaser lets the dealer/leasing company buy back the car. That gives the driver the enjoyment of the vehicle for 4 years, and none of the post warranty headaches.Just my 2 cents  ","Posts: 1,798",Member

Leasing works for periods of time usually less than 48 months and usually best for 39 or fewer months with mileage usually of 12 - 18,000 miles per year.My wife has a 16,000 mile per year lease on a 3 year term.Mine is 45,000 miles (an Audi) -- and Audi will gladly lease their cars for almost any term and mileage. A sales person who works for me just got a new Cadillac CTS with a 54,000 mile lease for 36 months ($515 per month, for 35 months, loyalty lease.)I thought I addressed the leasing issue from a broad point of view as suggested by my CPA firm:Buy that which appreciates in value.Rent that which depreciates in value.Cars, generally speaking are in the latter category.This does not mean that leasing will or even can work for everyone.The point, often, is that the effects of on buying and leasing are the same and the key ones are ""the cost of money, opportunity costs and time/miles, all of these things contribute to residual value"" which is a critical factor in leasing, financing or buying -- and I would argue equally so.A ","Posts: 5,343",Member

You said:Leasing seems a plus for those not driving many miles (Audi allows 12K/Yr max), and for cars with long warranties, but very high part and service expenses once the warranty has expired. Leasing is not generally any more of a plus for those not driving many miles. It might be, but the same factors that are a plus for a lease with respect to miles driven per year have a similar effect regardless of the method chosen to actually possess the car for x period of time and miles.Audi will lease a car for 10,000 12,000 15,000 and more miles per year. There is no technical max although there are practical reasons to not lease a car that you will drive 45,000 miles per year.The length of the warranty is not a factor in leasing any more than it is a factor in paying cash or financing -- how could it be? Why would it be?A leased car that is out of warranty (and any factory or dealer sponsored service agreements) will cost EXACTLY the same to maintain as a financed or 100% owned car. There are no special additional charges for a new power steering pump on a leased car that is out of warranty versus a car that is owned, for instance.Most leases are called ""closed ended"" leases -- this simply means that there are no hidden charges at the end of the lease. I agree to pay you $515 per month (for a 2006 Cadillac CTS with two popular option packages which retails for about $40,000) for 35 months (and use it for 36 months) during which time I must maintain the car (if I want to keep the warranty in force) -- I have agreed with you I can drive 54,000 miles without any charge per mile during this time period and I agree the car will be returned ""clean and with normal wear and tear and tires that are legal to be driven on the street of a size and composition similar to the OEM tires delivered on the car.""The long warranty cars and short warranty cars can be leased with equal ease and aplomb.The thing(s) that has (have) the greatest effect on the lease price are identical for you even if you plunked down 100% cash on the barrel-head:MSRPCost of money (yours or the financial institution)Depreciation over time (aka residual value).A $40,000 car that can be leased with no upfronts for 24 months @ $399 per month and driven for 30,000 miles is a ""subvented"" lease -- it is hard to imagine even a 0% interest loan beating this deal when depreciation is factored in.Leasing is NOT for everyone. Neither is paying cash or financing.But, the information and conclusions you presented did need some clarification. :surprise: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

No, I agree with the prior poster that satellite radio should either be a free throw-in (you do pay for service, you know!) or a standalone option. It's nice that VW gives you a choice between the 2, as many cars only give you 1 option (I think that happens when 1 of the sat. radio companies contracts with the manufacturer).Regardless, I had a free sat. radio subscription for several months and loved it, but once he free session ended, i didn't continue it. Hard to justify the monthly expense when I just travel to and from work, 30 min each way, and the radio stations come in clearly. Now if my car were the family vehicle we took on weekends and the kids didn't insist on listening to their Barney CD every time  :mad: , maybe that'd be different.PS - I'm annoyed the VW site won't let you configure a Jetta GLI!

I would suggest no. That is a pretty old vehicle - it started in 1999. $20,000 is overpriced in my opinion, but kbb said it's a good price but I don't understand how that is possible. It doesn't have the updated technology, safety, and quality improvments. For example, that car still had the thin accessory belt under the hood.

Help. Need to buy something!! I'm very concerned with 1) safety, then 2)price, then 3) looks, and I want to spend around $25,000.For safety results, I've been consulting both IIHS and Safercar.gov. The IIHS site lists rear crash tests, which is very helpful. There are very few perfect scores, but Saab and Subaru stand out.I could buy a Subaru, but it has no Electronic Stability Control which I gather is pretty important. Right? Even with AWD?I could buy a Saab 9-3, 2004 or 2005 models, Arc only as Linear is so maligned, but I'm worried about reliability.I could buy a Volvo S60 (the S40's too small) which got strangely opposite scores from the two safety sites, namely: IIHS rated it good for Front, but only acceptable for Side crash, and Safercars (Govt crash site) rated it 4 out of 5 stars Front, and 5 out of 5 Side.I'm happy to buy a used (ideally certified, right?) model to keep the costs down, esp as I need an automatic, and would like leather seats (maybe even heated!)The IS 250 and the BMW 325 garnered excellent across-the-board safety ratings from the IIHS only in the 2006 (therefore too expensive) models.Happy BTW to get a hybrid, but: the Prius has not so great rear crash results; also, am I the only one who finds its rear visibility is poor, due to the horizontal bar that divides the hatchback window..?In any case, my local car rental company loves me too much.

I would suggest you at least consider test driving the new Hyundai top o the line car, the Audi A3 and A4, the Honda mentioned, and keep educating yourself.Safety can be made up of some factors beyond crash results and star ratings. Don't get a one star with a bunch of electronic assists on the other hand.If, for instance, there are 4 star ratings, look at only 3 and 4 star offerings, but consider:#1 AWD#2 ABS+Brake Assist+ESP (or whatever the pitch and yaw control system is called by a particular mfgr.)These technologies will typically improve both performance and safety. Couple an inherently safe vehicle (the number of stars, for instance) with some performance/avoidance technologies, such as #1 & #2, and you may find a 3 star with betters a 4 star without.In your price range you will probably not be looking at cars that include lane departure warning technology or ACC (automatic cruise control) which will provide automatic braking based on proximity of other vehicles.Consider, too, that there are arguments for ""high performance"" options as safety enhancers and that there are often (moreso in the lower price ranges) optional extras, such as additional non mandated airbags (often costing at full MSRP a few hundred dollars) that you can add.Run flat tires? Hmm -- safety or convenience? Many would say ""both!""Homework ahead. :surprise: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

 The current volvo S40 is a cousin of the Mazda 3-and a European Ford as well-they are all built on the same platform. The Mazda3 does seem to get good reviews, especially when considering value. I don't think the Audi A4 belongs in the same conversation. They are great cars, but not the first car that comes to mind when you talk about reliability, at least based on reputation. If you're looking for a reliable car at $25,000 or less, there are many, many options.

Well, since you've decided to compare these three, I'll give you my opinion/experiences. I currently have a Volvo S40 T5 AWD. I've had it for about 3 months, and am pretty happy with it. I got the upgraded sound system, which I think is excellent. The acceleration is good, and everything else is acceptable to good. My complaints are a terrible amount of interior storage space-for CD's and such, and tight foot space between the pedals. Also, the fun factor is not up to my previous BMW 325xi. I am happy with my decision because it was cheaper than most other cars that I considered. If the A4 were offered at the same price as the S40, I don't think that the S40 could compete. The main advantage of the S40 T5, in my opinion, is that it's an AWD sedan that is near luxury with decent acceleration for about 30k. Even though I think the 325xi and A4 are better cars, I was not willing to pay extra for them. That's my thoughts, for what it's worth. Good Luck! ",Posts: 13,Member

The PRICES are quite different (or can be.)If you are price neutral, go with the Audi.If you are price cognizant and concerned consider the Volvo and check out the availability of a service and/or mntce plan for at least 50K miles.The Jetta can't be had with AWD but if that too is a neutral issue, it is the ""biggest"" bargain even though it has had some hard knocks in the dealer service and even in the FOR (frequency of repair) dept.The Audi is the ""best"" car based on content and performance overall. Styling is always subjective.The Volvo is ""nearly"" an Audi considering its price. The dealers are ? with Volvo? Probably better than the VW's and Audi seems to run hot and cold here, too. Most Audi dealers have stepped up over the past few years. They are not universally up to the standards of the Lux class that their cars generally are consider to be a part of.My dealer would get a ""9"" overall and many ""10's"" -- I have read some contrary opinions.I have driven the Audi and the Volvo. They are both good to very good. The Audi seems more, uh, ""refined"" and also more sure footed.But it is the most expensive of the trio.Maybe you gets what you pays for! :surprise: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

I'm concerned with safety...and there are two very useful sites, www.IIHS.org and www.safercar.gov, which rate various crash issues.. IIHS is interesting as it does a rear crash test ... which most cars do poorly at.Question #1: the Volvo S60, which has good rear scores, has scored 'good' on Front impact and 'ok' on Side Impact in the one site, but scored the reverse in the other site (i.e., 'ok' Front, 'good' Side). Anyone know about these sites and what this could mean?Question #2: the other car I've in mind is the Subaru Forester, which has no stability control (s.c.), but is AWD, and scores great on IIHS crash tests. Stability control is for skidding and has been much discussed by the professionals as an important safety feature, and there are other (namely German and Swedish) cars with both s.c. and AWD, so AWD is NOT the reason Subaru does not need to have s.c. [One Subaru dealer told me it was a cost issue: Subaru didn't want to pay for the cost of s.c.] So does an AWD car need s.c.?Any thoughts, anyone, on both these questions? ",Posts: 25,Member

A1. Different rating system.

In real life, the size of the occupant, angle of the hit, size of other vechicle.. will be important factor..A2.

To answer your questions--I have a manual transmission T5. It is smooth-I like it better than my '03 BMW 325xi. I've been using premium gas. According to the calculation displayed in my car, I am getting 22.9 miles per gallon at last check. That has not been reset since my first re-fuel, and I'm at about 3500 miles now. I would estimate that on the highway I get about 28, and in the city about 20, if I'm lucky. I've read about other people doing better than that, but I don't know how because I've been going pretty easy on the gas pedal and I still haven't gotten the average over 23-as soon as I drive around town for a few days it's back below 22mpg. I did not get, nor did I look into an extended warranty. I don't plan on holding onto cars too long.In regards to comments that people have posted about turbo lag----the T5 does have turbo lag, but you have to get used to the gear pattern. In my experience, most cars accelerate well in 2nd gear, but it seems like my car can't get out of its own way in 2nd. But in 3rd the thing gets going right away, no matter what the RPM's. It is a low induction turbo charger, so it is designed to provide boost at low RPM's. The upside is that it kicks in at lower RPM's, the downside being that the boost is relatively low, so it isn't supposed to really kick you in the pants ever. When I test drove the MazdaSpeed6, which has much more boost, you really felt in when it kicked in. So I have to say that turbo lag has not been much of a factor for me, now that I've gotten used to the gearing. I actually wouldn't mind a little more kick in the pants-it's pretty noticeable that this is a turbo charger not designed to knock your socks off. In the review of the T5 on Edmunds, the author commented on the gearing/turbocharger being one you have to get used to-I agree with that. I'm no car expert, however, and I'm sure some of the more technically-minded folks lurking around here could discuss turbos, gearings and such in a more educated fashion than I.DT ",Posts: 13,Member

April 2006 ",markcincinnati,"
This car demands a stick shift.Having said that, there are two schools of thought:The automatic will emasculate the T5, but will ""mask"" the turbo lag somewhat, but the performance becomes somewhat less than ""IMMEDIATE.""On the other hand, the stick shift may require you to learn some anticipatory driving to minimize the ""rush"" that can happen when you are in third gear and request more grunt -- and then the lag happens since the turbo's RPMs need to spool up to max torque range.If you know when to downshift to minimize lag, you will be fine.The specs on the engine, as I recall, do show torque does come on fairly low in the engine RPM range, so this may be -- for you -- a quick and short learning curve.If you want much of the fun and performance retained, the stick is your best bet. Sticks, however, are addicting and they are more and more rare.I caution you, if you get a stick, you will be hard pressed to ever be satisfied with an automatic again.Each drive line has its merits -- the one that increases:control, fuel-economy, fun, performance and safety (due to the improved control and performance) is the stick;the one that may be somewhat less involving, lower in performance and generate poorer fuel mileage is the automatic. You do get ""less work"" with the auto though.Choose the one that suits your needs. I have an Audi A6 3.2 it has an automatic. The BMW 530xi which can be had with a stick and is AWD was not on the market when I picked my Audi up. I drove the S60 type R and found the engine backfired too much for my comfort in a car that expensive. ","Posts: 5,343",Member

Hello,This is my first time posting here, so I hope this is the right spot to post.Anyway, I am looking to purchase a pre-owned sedan in the next couple of weeks and have narrowed it down to either a 2001 Volvo S40, a 2001 Volvo S60, or a 2002 Volkswagen Passat. All three are in the same approximate price range. There is approximately the same mileage on both volvos and a little more on the Passat. Trim levels are comparable (and more or less basic)Does anyone have an opinion (lol) on which would serve me better? I am selling my current coupe because I have a new daughter and we anticipate needing two to three car seats eventually. I like the handling of the S40 and the Passat (I haven't had a chance to drive the S60 yet).Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. ",Posts: 1,Member

my .02I owned a Passat for 3 years & a Jetta for 2 more (against my better judgement) and the reliability was pretty awful. So, I would be VERY skeptical of the 02 Passat. The S40 is not very sporty and doesn't handle/drive nearly as well as the Passat and the back seat is not as big as the Passat. So, it depends on your priorities:Drive/Handling: PassatReliability: S40 (or S60)Long Term ownership cost: Even (both are pretty expensive to keep up and if you're gonna own one of these for a long time, you may wanna consider a certified pre-owned or extended warranty)Looks: (IMHO) The PassatGas Mileage: Good in both, however, the Passat requires Prem Gas (not sure about the S40)Back Seat (for your new addition): Passat (however, with a rear facing seat, it's gonna be tight in both...both will be fine when she is front facing)Good luck and I hope this helps a little!

need to buy a new or slightly used (no more than 2 years old) car less than $27-28K.. here are my priorities:1) gas - should not use premium and should have good gas mileage if not at least the norm for sedans (24/31 or so)2) reliability - ok from what I've read, VW is havign issues with reliability but i'm interested in their 2006 pre-owned passat 2.0Ts .. of course, it is still too new for reliability but if people returned it to the dealer, is taht necessarily a bad sign? 3) luxury/styling - I'd say VW packs the most for the best price AND has done a good job on the styling. I'd go with a loaded accord or camry but their styling is bland. I wish I could get the acura tsx or even audi/lexus/etc but they all use premium gas and that is not what i need now..

I had a 2001.5 Passat for just over 3 years, which is the same as the 2002 model. I didn't look at the Volvos at that time so I can't really comment except to say that the S40 will likely be too small for your needs.I had minimal issues with the Passat, and really liked how luxurious it seemed. It was a great balance between comfort and sport - I had a 6 cyl manual transmission and was very happy with the torque, although HP was a bit too low. Overall, that redesigned Passat, from 2001.5-2005 is a really good, comfortable, safe car. It was consistently among consumer reports' recommended vehicles. ",Posts: 681,Member

Suydam gave a good post and I second his comments. Are you sure the Passat does not require premium? I had a prior model passat and it did require premium fuel. Also, I think 2006 was the 1st year of the redesign.

thanks to you and sudyam. I thought about the issue some more and will go to a dealerstrip (multiple dealerships within a mile) to look at some cars. I've eliminated the passat because of reliability issues.. I'm not that concerned about premium anymore because assuming that premium is always 20 cents more at any time, with 10K miles per year at 25 miles per gallon, I would spend only $80 more per year for the premium. Right now, I'm considering the following, in no order:1) certified pre-owned acura tsx (without navi) - can get one with 10K miles for $24,500. All the features for the buck, plus still gets good gas mileage. Does require premium.2) toyota prius (yes, on the other extreme of the scale, but I have yet to check it out). Packages seem expensive, not to mention it is in high demand and is being sold at msrp, no chance of negotiation.3) accord ex-l with/without navi - if only they could have done a better job with styling, I would have jumped on it.4) I would check out the camry if I didn't already have a 2005 camry SE. any others i should check out that would meet my priorities as listed in my previous post (1. gas mileage 2. reliability 3.styling/luxury) ?

The Maxx is very flexible in terms of interior setup, but the cargo space is not that big unless you either fold down the rear seats or remove the cargo shelf to allow cargo to ""poke up"" into the rear window line of sight.The Maxx forum here has more details.If you don't mind a ruff ride, the Maxx SS offers a pseudo-sports approach.Be warned that Malibu and Maxx are having suspension and brake problems. Supposedly in Mid 2006 the suspension issue will be addressed.Lastly, the Maxx has not been IIHS crash tested (only the Mailbu, which got a silver award provided you have curtain airbags).

My wife already knew she wanted a TSX - every time she saw one she would say - thats my next car! So we went in to take a test drive - BIG disappointment. The handling was poor (crummy in the corners) - the ride was harsh (bumpy / could feel every expansion joint) - both cars we drove had a buzzing sound coming out of the dash. We were also considering a different car for my daughter - so we drove a 2006 Civic the same day - the Civic and the TSX have about the same handling capabilities - the Civic has a better ride quality. The TSX does have more power than the Civic. The TSX is an old design - it is based on the 2002 European Accord - so if you want a 2002 Accord with leather that requires premium gas - buy the TSX. We took it off our shopping list - I can't understand why this car sells at all - there must be some car buyers that think that the Acura badge has some value and really don't care that it is really just a rebadged Accord. I would take the Accord over the TSX - but make mine a coupe. ","Posts: 1,986",Member

The firm ride is because of the sport suspension and low profile performance tires. My WRX has a very firm (some might call it harsh) ride too. It's ride is noticebly firmer and noiser than my son's Outback Sport. If you want ""sport,"" that's the price you pay.The Civic is not a performance car, with the exception of the Si. I'm sure its ride is tuned more for comfort than the TSX's. The Civic's tires do not have as low a profile, and therefore absorb the bumps much better, and the springs are softer too.I'm sure if you were to test two Mercedes E350s, one with the optional sport suspension and one without, you would find the same thing. The one with sport suspention and ultra-low profile tires would ride much harsher than the one with the standard suspension.Bob ","Posts: 19,788",Member

Ride and handling is normally a trade off - you want great handling you get a harsh ride - want soft ride give up some handling - Some how Acura was able to make the TSX ride like a car that should handle very well but does not - and handle like a car that has a soft ride - but doesn't. I think its the 2002 technology. In the sporty / near luxury car segment (whatever name you want to use) the car should have a firm ride but that does not mean you should feel every expansion joint in the road - thump - thump - thump - and it should handle 1000 times better than a $15K Civic. The TSX just plain falls short. You could be right about the tires - maybe Acura just kept the same suspension tuning as the 2002 European Accord and stuck for low profile tires on it. That could explain the ride and handling. ","Posts: 1,986",Member

These are both great choices and whatever u decide u won't regret it.the accord ex-l is pretty much loaded with all the goodies (dual heated seats, power driver seat, automatic dual climate control, 6 disc cd changer, led brake lights, etc), which u probably already know. You also mentioned the dvd navigation system which put the icing on the cake. The accord styling is attractive, but the tsx is much better looking, and for $500 more i would go with the tsx.I know u mentioned gas, and the tsx does use premium fuel which seems weird for a 4 cyl car. U do get more hp (34) with tsx, but i guess with it being a luxury car u just have to use premium.the tsx is fully loaded, only missing the dvd navigation system which is nice, but with standard features like, heated power driver and passenger seats, auto rear view mirror, 6 disc cd changer with a 320 watt 8 speaker surround sound system(compared to accords 120 watt 6 speaker system) xenon headlights, (which is a plus on value)and the cool looking turn signals on the mirrors makes this car worth getting for $24500. :shades: ",Posts: 15,Member

Go for the Bmw or the audi! I'd recommend the Audi A3 over both the Accord and the TSX.but between Accord and TSX, it all comes down to.... do you want power or gas mileage with regular fuel? Do you want luxurious interior, or just a nice interior?Acura has better warranty, but its not like you'll ever need to use the warranty with either vehicle. ","Posts: 12,906",Member

The burning of regular fuel should not even enter into the equation for many reasons.But, rather than ""prove"" that an engine designed for premium fuel is generally both more effective and more efficient, I will simply hit the money justification first in some detail.If you believe that Regular will be at least $2.50 per gallon and you also believe that plus ten cents per grade is generally the norm, let's look at this financially.Gas tank = 20 gallons, for instance.Fillup of regular = $50Fillup of premium = $54If you use one tank per week the annual cost would be $208 higher for the car that required premium. As the price of regular rises -- and unless the difference in price between premium and regular changes -- the cost actually goes down as a percentage of the total cost for 52 fillups.Assuming the consumption doesn't change, the difference will remain $4.00 per tankful, of course.=====There is and will continue to be a push for cars that require ever higher octane numbers. Indeed one of the advantages, for example, of E85 is that it can offer higher octane which is a good thing for a car engine's overall performance (performance being a deliberately broad term meaning to include effectivity and efficiency.)I am somewhat suspect of cars that claim to run on regular for I feel that a more efficient engine could be constructed but at the cost of requiring premium fuel.We all seem to want higher power (horses and twist) and better fuel economy. One of the ways that this can be accomplished is by raising the compression ratio (hence the need for higher octane fuel) of the engine.Broadly, generally and typically, I would, therefore, EXCLUDE the car in the class that used regular figuring that it might be less powerful, more thirsty and dirtier than a like volume engine (typically smaller in absolute terms, however) that has a higher compression ratio.I started out driving a 1963 V8 Chrysler Newport with a Firecracker 265 engine. It had a two bbl carb and produced 265 HP and it drank gas (which at the time was as low as 24.9 cents per gallon -- I am old, don't you know?)My current 3.2 (3.1L) V6 Audi engine has 255HP and it sips gas and feels every bit as powerful (this is a memory issue obviously since I do not have both cars side by side to test) if not moreso than that big ol' V8.This is a stark contrast, but the underlying concepts can be demonstrated today.There can be some pretty unimpressive engines in the ""performance"" regard who can claim ""yea, but at least we burn regular. . . .""I find such engines to typically suck gas and spew pollution -- both in quantities that exceed a higher compression engine that requires premium juice to run at its best.Power and gas mileage improvements often go hand in hand as manufacturers keep pushing their engine's compression ratios ever higher.Ignore the regular gas arguments, since there is plenty of evidence that can be shown to ""prove"" that many of the ""regular fuel is ok"" engines require more fuel and produce less power and more dirt than their premium sucking counterparts.Please remember that although I believe what I have just written that the statements are generalizations -- there are regular burning engines that run just fine and do not conform to my rather broad statements.Probably a good source for more info would be Popular Mechanics and a web site that can be googled ""how stuff works."" :shades: Nothing I have written suggests that using Premium in a car that is NOT designed to benefit from it will improve mileage or power. Conversely, nothing I have written should suggest that using Regular in a car designed for Premium is anything but a false economy and is indeed more wasteful. :surprise: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

In wunderful LA, CA, we have from 20 to 30 cent difference between reg and prem. One station near me (major brand) charges 3.31 for regular and 3.57 for premium. They dropped the regular price before they dropped the premium price.Having fun with figures: for a 1400 mile trip;CAR A: 24 mpg at 3.31 a gallon = $193CAR B: 18 mpg at 3.59 a gallon = $280CAR C: 30 mpg at 3.31 a gallon = $155CAR D: 22 mpg at 3.59 a gallon = $228So for the 1400 mile trip, Cars B and D (both the Audi 3 at its reported mpg's) will cost roughly $90 to $70 more for the trip than Cars A and C (brand X, which I know gets mileages listed).Having said that, does the extra fuel cost really matter to the Audi driver? IMHO, no sir-ree. ","Posts: 1,798",Member

I differ from your statement that increasing compression ratio increases power & fuel economy. Power is definitely increased but fuel economy rather drops. Fuel economy & power are inversely proportional. That's the reason for the advent of inline 4 engines. Moreover, power is not necessarily derived with more HP, rather it's the torque at low rpms & power-to-weight ratio that matter. Also, engines have a limitation for delivering power & hence it's noticed that a bigger engine gives you a higher range.High octane fuel avoids knocking in high compression engines. That's the reason they are used in high performance cars allowing the engine to squeeze out the maximum from the combustion. Also, they burn cleaner than regular gas with respect to high compression engines. For engines that are tuned to deliver superior fuel economy & moderate power, regular 87 octane gas is good enough.

The - HP is not important - its the torque that matters - statement - always makes me wonder.Do people understand that if you have an engine that produces ""a lot"" of low end torque it also produces ""a lot"" of low end HP? You can't increase torque - at any RPM level - without also increasing HP. Torque and HP are two different ways to measure engine power - if you give a value for either torque or HP and the RPM of the engine - you can calculate the other (torque or HP) value. Torque = (HP * 5252)/RPMHP = (torque * RPM)/5252Its (almost) like saying - that weight sure feels heavy - you know its the kilos that are important not the pounds. ","Posts: 1,986",Member

Accord I4: HP - 166 @ 5900 rpmTorque - 160 @ 4000 rpmThose are the max HP & torque available. Substituting the nos. in your equation@5800 rpm, torque = (166 * 5252)/5800 = 150.31@4000 rpm, HP = (160 * 4000)/5252 = 121.86Max torque of 160 lb-ft is achieved at 4000 rpm for which the HP is 121.86. This means that that the max torque of 160 lb-ft is achieved at a relatively lower HP (less than 166). This was my point.The aim is to achieve max torque at low rpm. This implies that the transmission needn't downshift to generate enough ""power"" at a lower rpm to drive the car. This scenario would give you better fuel economy which, was the subject of the discussion. ",Posts: 61,Member

While I love the discourse and the ""arguments"" we all from time to time engage in, I used the word ""often"" -- a deliberate use. What people buy is ""torque"" what they think they buy is horsepower.We are, generally, in agreement, that is.What ""often"" happens is a newer engine will be introduced in a given car line -- take the BMW 3.0 and both ""power"" (which is ""often"" both HP and torque) and MPG are improved.Literally, of course, the compression ratio of both the older engine (also 3.0) and the newer version were such that Premium Fuel is required in both.Further, the engines in this example go from X ""power"" and X dirtiness to Y ""power"" and dirtiness. In other words the engine gets more powerful, less thirsty and cleaner.The Audi/VW engine technology (FSI) is another advance and in this case is accompanied by ever higher compression.In this engine's case the ""power"" is upped, the ""frugality"" is also upped and the ""dirtiness"" is downed.And, to further point some deliberate word use, I said power rather than attempt to specify (overall) either HP or torque.My ""argument"" was very general (but I do believe not a misrepresentation or obfuscation) and meant to suggest that someone NOT be turned off by the requirements for Premium fuel. My thesis was to suggest that sometimes cars that burn regular fuel provide their owners a false sense of economy, sometimes a VERY false sense that, were they to calculate would darn near shock them and certainly surprise them.I am, despite this, NOT suggesting the exclusion of a car solely on the fact that it burns regular. There are plenty of examples (on both sides) that can be used to justify one's choice.Overall, generally, typically, broadly speaking and ""on average"" many cars that use Premium Fuel generate a more pleasing ownership experience for they offer greater power, efficiency, economy and lower pollution.This is not an absolute as I have painstaking attempted to convey, however.This forum is a great place for all of us to ""learn new stuff"" get new, to us, ideas. :shades: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

Sorry - I sometimes get carried away - and go way - way overboard. My point is - HP and torque are just different ways to measure engine power - you can also measure engine power in watts (same watt as a light bulb!) or even BTU's All of these values can be converted into each other - none are ""better"" at any given RPM level because - they would be considered equal in terms of power. Its just like you can measure distance in feet - inches - meters - yards - You can measure weight in tons - pounds - ounces - kilos - grams - Temperature - C or F take your pick They are all just different ways to measure something - Sure I want an engine that produces good power at an RPM level that I can actually use while I drive my car in normal traffic - it would be nice to have this power available in the 1,500 to 3,500 RPM range (low end)- because - even if my engine would turn 12,000 RPM I would not spend much time driving at this level. I think this is what most people really mean when they say low end torque is more important - could also say low end BTU's are more important than high end watts - but I better stop before the host kicks my behind - again!BTW - I always thought that the reason higher compression engines of the same displacement could produce more power was because they could have more air/fuel in the combustion chamber - isn't this what causes the higher compression ratio? The valves close and the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture before the spark plug causes ignition. Premium fuel (higher octane) prevents the air/fuel mixture from burning before the spark plug fires (pre ignition)This is why burning premium in a car designed for regular does not produce any more power - and is just a waste of $$.

And to your final point, why burning lower octane in a car designed for Premium is a false economy (costs more over time) and despite electronic aids that prevent the sounds of pinging, is also a waste of $$.I remember my dad -- he would NOT buy any car that required premium (or as he called it Ethyl) period. He bought a new Chrysler in 1963, the 361 CI could use regular and some of the other two or three engine choices (383 v1 and v2 and 413 CI) had to use Ethyl, so he chose the one that used regular and then spent what seemed to be a ton of money to put in an aftermarket air conditioner since, at the time, it seemed that only the cars that used Premium had factory air.No amount of argument would dissuade this behavior which seemed, at the time and to this day, as a kind of weird way to save a couple of pennies per gallon whilst spending hundreds and hundreds on an aftermarket accessory that essentially took the space of one passenger.My dad bought three new cars without factory A/C that used regular gas in the 60's and performed (or had performed, better said) this add-on.False economy then, just for somewhat of a different reason or cause.Some of the folks I work with buy cars that require premium and run them on regular -- maybe it just makes them feel better, evidence to the contrary.:confuse: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

Bill, I was just stating an example to make my point clear on the ""low end torque"". A better example would be to compare I4 Accord with CR-V. Both vehicles share the same engine but CR-V has a max torque of 160 lb-ft @ 3600rpm compared to 160 lb-ft @ 4000rpm of Accord. But, Accord's 166hp is greater than CR-V's 156hp engine. The CR-V has a towing capacity of 1500lbs vs Accord's 1000lbs. Moreover, the over-all ""power"" is not just derived by the HP & torque numbers. There are many parameters to be considered like, power-to-weight ratio, body design, payload capacity etc. Anyway, it looks like we have made our points clear!Happy & safe driving.

Displacement or engine displacement is not hard to understand. Picture the volume of air in an empty 20 ounce bottle of Coke - sort of. For example - the size the Mazda3 engine is a 2.3 liters - the Civic has a 1.8 Liter - My Z71 PU has a 5.3 liter.Engine displacement is defined as the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can draw in during one complete engine cycle - In a piston engine (normal car engine) this is the volume of fuel and air that is sucked into the cylinder as the pistons are moved from top dead center to bottom dead center - for each cylinder times the number of cylinders. So a Mazda 2.3L has .575 liters of volume for each of its 4 cylinders. About the size of a 20 ounce bottle of Coke for each Cylinder. My 5.3L V8 is closer to a 24 ounce bottle - but times 8. In general - larger displacement = more air/fuel in the combustion chamber = more engine power. Back in the old days they used cubic inches instead of liters - but it is really the same concept - just a different unit of measure. The most common way to change engine displacement was by changing the length of the stroke (how far the piston travels) or you can change the bore (diameter of the piston). When gas was cheap the answer to more power was larger displacement - more air/fuel. GM produced a 283 cubic inch engine - but by changing the crank shaft (which changed the stroke) they could also turn the same basic engine into a 307 or a 327. ","Posts: 1,986",Member

You can easily look through the new cars by price-range on www.edmunds.com. You can probably do something like that for used cars, too.

Although the statement ""greater displacement, the more power"" is generally accurate, it is not always correct.There is an old statement that goes like this: there's no replacement for displacement. This statement is, broadly speaking, true.But, in an era of ever improving design, electronics and naturally and artifically inducted ""systems,"" it is indeed very possible for a V8 of XXX displacement to be a weakling when compared to a V6 or i6 or even i4 with XX or X displacement.Try this on for size, a [late 70's] Pontiac 6.6 liter V8 output 200HP. A mid 2000's Audi 1.8 liter i4 output 225HP.The V8 did have over 300lb-ft of torque, and the i4 has over 200lb-ft. So, all things being equal (and they would not be) the 6.6 would still sprint to 100kph more quickly.Yet, the Audi V8 4.2 engine was rated at 300HP and 295lb-ft of torque but was outgunned to 100kph by the V6 2.7 engine rated at 250HP and 258lb-ft. Why?The torque available from the V8 didn't come on until AFTER 3,000 rpms. The lower torque of the V6 was ready to go at 1850 rpms.While there may be ""no replacement for displacement"" -- there may be an asterisk that should be placed after that:""except for volumetric displacement."" Essentially, increasing the amount of air/fuel that an engine can ""digest"" will increase its HP and torque without an increase in displacement.Is bigger better?It can be.It does not have to be, however.Be aware of the benefits that will generally accrue with greater displacement -- just be aware, too, that size is not the end all be all in terms of determining engine power, pollution and efficiency.

Since I personally participate most frequently here on Edmund's LPS forum, most of what I have observed does seem to come from these posts. Yet, as I browse through these forums more and more, I find folks seemingly lamenting their purchases or struggling with even the thought of making a purchase of a new car.Where to begin, where to begin. . . Too often we read (here on these forums) the complaints, disappointments and regrets of some of the participants about their new cars. Take these for instance:o	I can&#146;t find a comfortable setting for the seato	The air conditioner can&#146;t cope with the heat wave we&#146;re having this year o	The transmission starts out in 2nd gear and the thing just doesn&#146;t have enough power to safely merge onto the Interstateso	I can&#146;t get my Bluetooth phone to synch up &#150; I just bought my phone and no one told me that all Bluetooth phones aren&#146;t compatibleo	Eighty bucks for a pair of wiper blades?!? Eighty bucks! How can they charge that much, this is robbery!o	Do I have to use Premium gas? If I had only known I had to use Premium, I wouldn&#146;t have bought this thing.o	40 series tires &#150; these things are a $1,000 a set and they start to go at 15 or 16,000 miles &#150; yikes!o	This thing drinks gas.o	Rides like a truck.o	Rides AND handles like a sofa! My sofa probably handles better, in fact.o	The iPod adapter won&#146;t work unless you have the Premium package and upgraded sound system with navigation and bidet.o	I can&#146;t change the radio station without going through the climate control menu first o	And so on and on and on.Now some of these complaints or issues can be attributed to the manufacturer, some even to the dealer; but, overall, most of the unhappy campers became unhappy because of their own actions (or inaction.) ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" It is certainly possible to find auto buying advice articles here and elsewhere. And, most of the suggestions made in these articles are reasonable and valuable. But, few of the articles &#150; if any &#150; ever seem to elaborate on the amount of work it actually takes to make a sound decision, a decision that you can live with for 3, 4, 5 or more years. While the process of buying a car is, for most of us, an avocation, not a vocation, it cannot be simply and entirely treated as a &#147;fun exercise.&#148; Having fun while making a multi-tens of thousand dollar decision is possible, but if you neglect the work that should be part of this process, you may run the risk of making the ownership experience less enjoyable than you had expected. You stand a decent chance of regretting your decision, in fact.Now, I am not talking about buying your very first car &#150; although I do believe most of what needs to be done in buying a car applies to your first or twenty-first &#150; for you simply will not have the history (that is part of the process) to relate to.Here, then, are some thoughts about the process that may reduce or prevent buyer&#146;s remorse.o Know the Style you Wanto Know your ""Willingness to Afford"" Metrico Read what the Pros Sayo Compile a Listo Test Driveo Go for it ","Posts: 5,343",Member

Know the Style you WantBefore you begin the &#147;automotive buy cycle&#148; do some homework. Remember style does count &#150; and for most folks, style counts right up there in the top 2 or 3. For some folks style is number 1 and everything else is secondary. If you consider style above all else you should know that there is nothing wrong with that even though there will be some folks who will tell you differently. If you love everything about a car EXCEPT its style, it will be difficult to be a satisfied owner. After all, there are a few folks who think the Pontiac Aztec was a good looking design, aren&#146;t there? Remember that most of us look at our cars exteriors and get down to business from the interior. Don&#146;t discount the exterior and interior style. If you hate the looks of the 6000 S.U.X. it will be difficult to convince yourself that its use of gyroscopically gimbaled arbitrary capillaries for low rolling resistance and improved torsional rigidity justifies your selection of it. If you just can&#146;t see yourself driving the thing, well, &#147;there&#146;s a clue.&#148; Take it (the clue)Pick cars that you think are attractive is the message here.Know your &#147;Willingness to Afford&#148; MetricBefore we continue, let&#146;s not forget that eventually you will have to cull most of your choices for one or several reasons. You will ultimately have to narrow the field based on price. Within limits it is not necessary to do this at this time. Now, &#147;within limits&#148; means you know the upper limit of your willingness to afford something. Most of us who acquire cars (especially new cars) would be able to &#147;get a deal done&#148; on a car priced 50% or more higher than we would likely consider. It is very possible that you could be looking at a car with an MSRP of $40,000 and find yourself able to qualify for a $60,000 car (even though you would have to eat bread and water and keep your house hot in summer and cold in winter to do so.) Do know that MSRP&#146;s sometimes are steeply discounted (I&#146;ve seen $50,000 Cadillac&#146;s advertised for $9,995 as a single lump sum 27 month 12,000 mile per year lease payment -- translated assuming a zero rate of return into $370/mo if you understand you must cough up the $9,995 up front.) Do know that if you are shopping for a payment that the MSRP and the monthly payment may only be related coincidentally. It is unlikely that you will be looking for a car with an MSRP of $25,000 and &#147;settle for&#148; a car with a $50,000 MSRP &#150; but when $50,000 cars are discounted by $10,000 and then offered at 72 months same as cash &#150; the realm of possibilities changes. On the other hand, know what&#146;s out there at several price points. You may find that you want a luxury performance car but that a near luxury performance car with stability control and satellite radio (two features commonly found on LPS cars) will satisfy you. In other words, it may be possible to crack the features and options code and match them with your wants and needs simply by knowing more of &#147;what&#146;s possible.&#148; This behavior may seem contradictory (shopping well above your price range, i.e.) until you realize the features that can be added to cars considerably lower in price point. Ignorance is not bliss, DOH!Find your &#147;willingness to afford&#148; ceiling within the current climate&#146;s &#147;realm&#148; is the message. Don&#146;t waste a serious amount of your time on cars that you would never be willing to afford. But, when appropriate, do &#147;expand your horizons&#148; based on the current market. Read what the Pros SayReading &#147;professional&#148; test reports can be enlightening, entertaining and exasperating. It will almost always be possible to find a review of the apple of your eye that says it is outdated, too expensive, too cheap, well made, poorly made, handles great, rides rough, has perfect fit and finish or is a rattle trap.Sometimes when a new car is reviewed the author will drool all over with praise; then, two months later when the car is part of a four car test it will come in fifth (or so it will seem) in the field. What to do?If you are so inclined, start reading the reviews of several writers over many months. Eventually, you may find a connection between yourself and the writers. Some folks, for instance, swear by USA Today&#146;s Ed Healy, some swear at him. Some trust Car and Driver&#146;s editors and discount Motor Trend&#146;s as &#147;shills for the manufacturers.&#148; Others believe Automobile Magazine is the holy grail of automotive journalism. Consumer Reports and JD Powers are the choices of others although CU and JDP are more heavily weighted toward percentages, ratios and statistics and less concerned with the emotions than perhaps the editors and contributors to Road and Track or Car and Driver or House and Garden.The message? Know what is being written about the population of cars you will soon be test driving. Even though there are many sources of opinion, it is generally true that you will be able to determine the characteristics of the new XYZ if you have read three articles or so and they all point out the lack of lateral support in the seats or the vague steering or the loud popping sounds that can be heard when the suspension is compressed while driving over a speed bump, etc. At the conclusion of most test reports you will see some statistics (and sometimes the manufacturer&#146;s claims will be published alongside.) If the car of your dreams cannot muster more than 12 MPG in any of the test reports (and that is an area of concern for you), you should note this fact and be guided accordingly.Compile a ListWrite down as many attributes, characteristics, features, etc, as you can think of that are important to you in a car. Start with a broad brush, for instance, ""performance"" and ""comfort"" are two characteristics that many folks are looking for. However, under the word ""performance"" you need to tick off what performance means to you. Does it mean acceleration from 0 to 60 mph? Does it mean how well the car can take corners? Or, does it simply mean how long it takes to bring the car to a stop under &#147;urgent&#148; circumstances? What you are trying to get to is your definition of performance in this instance. You may tell the sales person you are interested in a car that performs well. If the sales person thinks this means straight line acceleration and you think it means the ability to drive through &#147;S&#148; curves with very little body roll at high speed, there will be a disconnect. Determine what you want to call the traits you are looking for and then break them down so that they can be explained to the sales rep.If, by &#147;comfort,&#148; you mean little or no road and wind noise, but you are not interested in a cushy, isolating ride, and your sales rep thinks that you are looking for a softly sprung vehicle, well, you may be shown a car that, for you, &#147;lacks comfort&#148; since you didn&#146;t list your definition of comfort and the salesperson's doesn't track with yours.

Compiling this list is one of the most difficult things to do for most people when they go shopping for a car. Yet, when the list of complaints and regrets post purchase are verbalized, it is often that the sales person presented you with a car he thought you would buy based on some fairly vague descriptions -- that you provided. If you are interested in a ""four-door coupe,"" don&#146;t simply say ""coupe"" &#150; for coupe generally means two doors. If you are interested in a car that can take corners &#147;like its on rails&#148; and has low road and wind noise, don&#146;t simply say you want a car that performs well and is comfy. Spell out what you want.Explain (and make sure it is on your list) the attributes you are looking for and define them. Your list could be seen as a glossary of the &#147;terms of endearment&#148; that will be important to you. This is the list that you should share with your sales rep.Take enough time to make a meaningful list &#150; this is one of the most important things you can do to help you make up your mind.Test DriveNote: Only if you will literally not involve anyone else in the buying, driving and owning process, should you do this alone.Before you begin taking test drives of new cars you may potentially consider buying, take a test drive in your current car. Take your current car out first to map out the test drive loop you will be using for all the cars you plan to consider. In the instance where the cars you want to test are sold by dealers that are geographically widespread, you may have to come up with more than one test drive loop (here in Cincinnati, for example, the Infiniti Dealer and the Volvo Dealer are some distance apart, and either you will need to create a test drive course that is somewhere in the middle or create two courses that you are VERY familiar with in your current car.)Taking the first test drive in you current car will serve several purposes. First, you will be able to concentrate on creating the route and determining the traits you are attempting to suss, rather than trying both to figure out where to drive and getting used to the controls, seating position and feel of an unfamiliar vehicle. Second, you will be able to put your current car through its paces and ""record"" your impressions for comparison purposes. Although many of us generally believe a ""new car"" will be ""better"" than our current car, it can be quite revealing -- as you are driving the new car under evaluation -- to know that you can negotiate a curve at 40MPH comfortably in your ""old"" car. When the new car can only negotiate the curve at 40MPH too, it may be quite ""enlightening."" Furthermore, if the new car can only round the corner easily at 35MPH, that will be a real eye opener.During your test drive of your current car, take many notes. If, for instance, you want a car that can accelerate from point to point quickly, you need to know how your current car fares in this area. If you want to go from 30 to 70MPH as fast as possible, you need to know how long it takes in your current car to do this. Write it down. Then, when you challenge the new cars you are considering to do the same, write their times down, too. Your current car will serve as a base-line. As you compile the results from the different cars you are considering, you will have a point of reference. The actual time and the seat of the pants time may differ. You may end up deciding to go with the car that feels quicker even though it actually is a half-second slower -- but at least you'll know.Your test loop should include as many ""real world"" sections as you feel represents ""your reality"" not the salesperson's. If you will not be taking your vehicle off road, for instance, your test loop may mislead you if you attempt to make the tester climb rocks and ford streams. If you will be needing ample acceleration (""ample"" as defined in ""your list"" as 0 - 60MPH in under ""X"" seconds) don't assume great high speed stability (a ""fast"" car) is the same as a ""quick"" car. If you care about both rapid acceleration and high speed cruising, your test loop should challenge the car being tested to both. Once again, knowing what your current car can do and how it feels can be an important means to an end.Taking your current car and the cars you are considering over the same test drive loop and attempting as much as possible to ""stress"" them similarly is almost the only method that can lead you to objective information gathering. Even if the sales person rides along with you and ""suggests"" a route for you, it is important that you are able to experience the car on your familiar test loop. You want to spend time getting a feel for and of the new car -- not trying to figure out where you are and how to get back to the dealership. Taking the time to map out a test route that you are familiar with will pay off. Although you probably will want to know about the new car's sound system, it is important to make at least one loop of your test route without the distraction of the sound system.During the test drive, you should not be unwilling to fully test acceleration, braking and cornering capability. You should not be willing, however, to push the demonstration car so hard that it is pushed way beyond its limits -- you do not have permission to drive in such as fashion that a reasonable person would believe could be damaging or dangerous (to person or property.) Driving the car in a circle in a parking lot may be part of your routine to determine body roll and the speed at which oversteer or understeer becomes evident. Cranking the wheel to full-lock and flooring the accelerator pedal for 90 seconds is probably not a good idea even if the sales person lets you take the car out by yourself. You do not want to abuse the vehicle under consideration is the point -- you do, however, want to have an understanding of the ""performance envelope."" Were there only such thing as common sense.Generally, you will want to test the car on residential streets, secondary, primary and Interstate highways. You should test the car within certain parameters that do, in the main, represent the way you drive. If you routinely drive above 80MPH on Interstate highways, you need to know how the car you are considering feels at such speed under these conditions. Don't drive out of the dealer's lot onto a secondary highway within the city limits and see how quickly you can reach 80 in a 35 zone. If that is the way you drive YOUR car -- fine, drive your car that way -- do not drive the dealer's demo that way (unless you don't ever plan on returning.)Testing the brakes is very important, but repeatedly taking a car with 5 miles on the odometer out on the local freeway, running it up to 80MPH and slamming on the brakes would generally be frowned upon by most dealerships.

There are ways to determine if the brakes meet your expectations -- hard, but perhaps not full-on panic stops can give you the info you need (especially if you have your car's capabilities documented and can determine a braking test that you can repeat in a variety of cars.) I have a little orange cone that I can set out on a large parking lot, accelerate to 40MPH or more and when I am even with the cone brake hard to a stop and either record the time it takes to stop or put a second cone down so that I know the distance traveled between 40MPH and full stop.Test the sound system (unless this is irrelevant to you) -- bring your own tunes and set the system in the car you are testing to the sound that pleases you and make notes ""no bass, but great clarity,"" ""system sounds muffled and lost reception on AM stations easily,"" ""plays DVD-audio,"" etc. Test the ""avionics"" (e.g., sat nav) and all of the systems that ""matter to you."" Turn on the windshield wipers, open the sunroof, roll the windows up and down, ""play with everything."" My 2005 Audi A6 has 82 buttons, knobs, switches, dials, thumbwheels, gauges, screens, needles and roller wheels that are meant to be controlled by the driver. Without voice response, the car would be very difficult and sometimes dangerous -- even with the Multi-Media Interface. I.E., does your new car offer voice activation? Should you consider it?If it is a hot day get the car as hot as can be and see how cool you can make it -- if 90+ humid degrees is a typical summer day for you, make certain the interior of the car (front and back seat, if applicable) can be cooled to your liking. Jus' cause the climate control says 67 degrees ""don't make it so!""Check the oil -- can you figure out how to open the hood, find the dipstick, look at it and replace it and close the hood without a technician? Put some gas in it -- does the design of the body and the filling hardware seem likely to be a cause for consternation?Check the spare tire, if it has one, does it appear that if you HAD to you could change a tire, or is this a job solely for professionals?Find out the length of the service intervals and the approximate cost of major and minor cycles. Find out what kind of gas is required -- if it says Premium in the manual, on the dashboard or on the filler door, it means it -- do not ask the salesperson, or if you do and he says ""it can use regular,"" realize that is not what it is designed to use.Write everything down (that is important or will be important to you should you buy this car.)When you have made your first round of test drives, you will probably reduce the number of cars under consideration. Even if you have not yet created your short list, you should repeat the test drive process. But, this time test the cars in a different order. If, originally, you had driven a VW Passat, a Camry, an Accord, a Chrysler 300 and a Lucerne -- in that order -- reverse or at least mix up the order of your test driving the second time around. The reason to do this is twofold: to minimize the effect of test drive fatigue and to reduce the effects of the ""last car driven."" The last car driven is more frequently the car many people buy. The reasons this happens may or may not be an influence on you and they may be statistically insignificant. However, the psychology seems to work something like this -- people who have not made up their minds in advance usually do not buy the first car they test drive and often buy the last car they test drive. As far as the reasons for this, there are articles and op-ed pieces you can google. Suffice it to say, typical advertising copy produced by car dealers urges prospective customers ""to shop Smith Brothers last!""Unless you have made up your mind, mixing up the order of the test drives from first round to the second round and so on, will ""encourage"" you to be as objective as you can be.Go for ItAfter all the test driving and note taking and note comparing, you will eventually get your list down to one or two or three vehicles that you think you would buy. You need to do but one last thing when you reach this point -- rank the cars independent of price and dependent on price. If car ""A"" is your first choice, price independent, you then need to write down a percentage amount your first choice is ""worth"" over your second or third choices. For instance, if the Lucerne is your top choice and the 300 is number two, is there any amount more you are willing to pay for the Lucerne? Put another way, if the 300 were 5% less (per month or in cash or lease payment) would that be enough to make you take the 300 over the Lucerne? Would you take the Lucerne if it were 10% more than the 300? In other words, if the cars each were offered with a monthly payment of $399 for 39 months, you know you would take the Lucerne. But, ask yourself, if you would still take the Lucerne if the 300 were offered at $359 per month? Only you can decide -- and this will tell you how price sensitive you are or just how close these cars were to each other. In my case the Audi A6 3.2 was my top choice and the Infiniti M35X my second. The M35X when it was $200 per month less than the Audi on an identical lease became my top choice. When the Audi's price lowered, it became, once again, my number one choice. The Audi, as it turns out, was worth more than the Infiniti, just not $200 per month more. In the end, the Audi dealer made me a deal I couldn't refuse on the car I wanted most anyway.Finally, determining ""the financing"" is not unimportant. It was, however, my purpose to get you to the point of selecting a car you can live with -- free of most or all regret -- for at least the duration of the financing or the number of years you plan to keep your next car.Picking out a new car can be an entertaining and educational exercise. But, it will be a lot of work, rewarding work, if you really want to do it right.Additional Thoughts Klik Here ","Posts: 5,343",Member

I've owned Prizms and Sentras before and have never had problems with either. That was years ago. Now I have a decision to make. I just bought a 1990 Prizm base model, auto, only 112,000 miles for $600. It already had a new radiator, and a transmission with a cooler installed about 3 years ago. I put in another $600 for a starter, timing belt, some gaskets and seals, new serp belts, and a few other things. This car passes emission like a new car with almost 0 reading and had only one owner and generally taken care of. It's the 5 door hatchback and has a cracked dash and drooping ceiling fabric but the body and paint are nice and shiny. I was going to keep this for myself. Then I was enlisted to find another good deal for my brother in law and a week later found the following:1994 Sentra XE, 2 door, manual trans with 135,000 miles for just $800. Again only one owner and generally taken care of. Had to replace the original clutch and replace the crankshaft seal (I think) and dished out about $600 for that. It passes inspections as well with flying colors. It came with a new alternator but nothing else has been replaced since brand new. The interior on this is almost perfect and the outside has a bit of a dent but other than that the body and paint are in excellent condition. It's a lot sportier than the Prizm, it's got a spoiler and some nice aftermarket wheels.Alright then, so if you guys owned both of these cars which are pretty equal in their condition mechanically and somewhat cosmetically, which would you keep? There are no recalls on either of them but I'm not aware of any notorious problems with either, except for Nissan's alternators. I'm also taking into consideration that this Prizm was perhaps one of the best designed bulletproof motors Toyota ever made. What I wish I could do is switch out the motors and then hands down I'd be picking the Sentra. But I'm not going to do that. So, I welcome your opinions and thanks in advance. If you need more info to make the decision, let me know. ",Posts: 2,Member

I'm sure this comes up all the time pertaining to the Accord and Camry, but which one would be a better choice for me.I have a traveling job where interior room and cargo room are very important to me. I don't want to spend much more over 20K if I can help it. I also get paid on mileage, so the better gas mileage I get the more money I make! I need a car that is going to be reliable and last for years to come. Right now I'm driving my 95' Monte Carlo and I think it's time for a update. After checking out what's out there for cars I always came back to 3 cars: Impala, Accord, and the Camry. I decided to not go with the Impala due to the V6 getting bad gas mileage compared to a 4 CYL Camry or Accord. And now I'm stuck with these 2 models that stack up to each other practically feature to feature. The only big difference I think is that I can probably get the 07' Accord cheaper than the 07' Camry due to the fact that everyone wants a new styled Camry right now. ",Posts: 3,Member

I'm going to be a contrarian here -- the answer to your Accord or Camry question is easy: Hyundai.Recently, I spent two days -- including test driving a number of cars, including Acura, Honda, Hyundai and Toyota.Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, feature for feature, warranty protection for warranty protection (etc etc etc), the Hyundai is the ""optimum"" -- NOT the MAXIMUM, but the optimum.High value, sure. I expected that.High content, hmmm. I was impressed by Hyundai.In almost every category, the Hyundai either exceeded or at the very least was the serious rival of the Japanese version.Were I spending MY money between $20 to $25K, the Hyundai would be ranked more highly than either of these Japanese cars.At the $25K plus price point, I would look seriously at an Audi A3 sedan, especially if I had a passion for ""performance"" driving.The Accord and Camry are too much money for too little car, with the Hyundai being, ""just right."" :surprise: ","Posts: 5,343",Member

People do have car seats in the back of the IS.They're not easy to load, and you'll have to deal with the shoe marks constantly being left on the rear of the front seats, but the kids will fit.In fact, kids are the only people who can.I'm like you.I visited Lexus and absolutely fell in love with the IS.We ended up buying the wife's MDX first, so I'm waiting until spring to pull the trigger on my car.As much as I love the IS, I'm slipping more toward the TL.I'm also waiting to see what the 07 G35x does for me, but the car has been problematic in previous years, so I'm hesitant.(See brake lawsuits and non-functional Bluetooth issues)The TL has a larger back seat and my 3yr old is very comfortable back there.And after taking one from the dealer for a day, I have to say that it's more fun to drive than the IS250.Now, the IS350 is another story...

What you should do is take the car seats with you to the dealership and see how they fit. What s/he said! (Sorry, I couldn't resist, esp. now that ""Pat"" has his/her own Wikipedia entry.)But back to the real subject. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to take car seats into the dealership and install them (backward and/or forward facing) in an IS250 demo. Just be sure you put the driver's seat in a driving position that's comfortable for you, and the passenger seat that's in a position that's comfortable for your usual front seat passenger. The dealership should be MORE than happy to help you out, primarily because they'll understand that anyone who goes to this trouble is a pretty darn serious customer and a sale almost certainly depends on the outcome. fwiw -- Britax Roundabouts fit just fine in the back of the Acura TSX, a car not too different in size than the IS250.I hope this works out for you.

 ""What you should do is take the car seats with you to the dealership and see how they fit.""Absolutely! I use to sell Lexus (and had a lot of 'unathorized' fun in the IS). It is not unusual for people to transfer the car seat to the car they are considering. I preferred that to the other alternative - one party staying behind with the children. I even suggested and assisted with the seat transfer. It will be tight in the rear of the IS for two car seats.Some suggestions, come during a weekday rather than the weekend - particurally if just scouting, as there is more time to assist with the transfer, and test drive on the 'long route.'. If a spouse is part of the decision process and can't attend during the week, it gives you a good out to return during the weekend to close a deal if appropriate and/or try the competition's offerings. (Sales people hate me for saying that, as the would prefer to meet as many prospects on the weekend rather than deliver a done deal.)While trying the car seats, within the same class, consider the BMW 3 Series. It has a larger back seat and may be more accomodating. Also, I was just looking at the new Infiniti G35, nice car with a rear seat comporable to the BMW but just can't get past the standard chrome strip immitation spoiler on the trunk. Why did they make that distraction standard? Audi A4 and Mercedes C rear seat size between the Lexus and BMW.As you compare sizes, also notice accessability. What is the door opening like.Another thing most people don't think of - interior colors and children. If not black, Lexus colors are very light - which gives an open airy feeling. Unfortunately, they become dirty fast - particurally the light carpet.Remember, it is your money and you - not the salesman - will be living with the decision. Do what is necessary to make an informed choice on your timetable. ",Posts: 3,Member

The parts for Volvo are most likely on par with BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar. The US parts are cheaper. The more considerable cost is the labor for installation. It also depends if the parsts are major (trans, motor, electronics). Routine maintenance parts should not be an issue. Search the web for ""Volvo Repair"" and the model you are interested in to see if you can get further info and check out the Volvo Forum on Inside Line also.

I have to order a new company car and my choices are either the Chrysler 300 Base (2.7L V6) or the Volvo S40 2.4 inline 5 (no options in choosing a different engine).

They are distinctly different cars and I am having a hard time choosing. I am leaning towards the 300 as it is much roomier (2 teenage daughters will be occasional back seat passengers) and has a much better sound system (I will be doing A LOT of highway cruising, but will also be my main car around town, so lots of city driving in traffic also). However the 2.7L engine sounded whiny during my short test drive yesterday. Plus the visibility (esp. out the rear view mirror) was an issue. The Volvo, though, felt crisp even with a small engine and ran quieter, I thought. However the back legroom was very cramped and I am giving up a better sound system as well as front seat storage space. One last factor in the decision is that in 3 years, I can purchase my company car, right when my daughter is turning 16. Seems to me the S40 would be a better choice for a teenager than a 300.My question to anyone out there driving a base 300 is how you like it for long trips on the highway AND driving in traffic around town? Same question for the Volvo S40. I currently drive a 2004 Impala so the 300 is a slight step up in size and the Volvo is a big step down in size. I think both cars look great, but the Volvo just feels better driving. Any input you could provide on driving the 2.7L 300 would help in my decision. It has a lot more space and entertainment options (does the base 300 have steering wheel radio controls?), but I am concerned about the road noise and engine power. The Volvo also has a small engine but it is 500 pounds lighter. Thanks. ",Posts: 4,Member

If you plan to buy for your daughter at lease end, then hands-down the S40. Can you upgrade any options out of pocket? My old company used to allow that. You would be able to choose some of your desired upgrades at your own expense. The other option is ask the dealer if they offer an upgrade to the sound system which you can pay separate.Good luck.Regards,OW ","Posts: 8,666",Member

I agree that based on the criteria, the Passat should be eliminated from contention. It is safe, but probably less reliable than the other two, and (I think) only the 6 cyl is as powerful as the Maxima. The G will blow them both away.If you prioritized luxury, that would favor the Passat.Only negative I've heard on the Maxima is that there is significant torque steer, which can be dangerous for an unwary driver.

The Infiniti is much smaller inside than the Maxima - something to consider based on how large your family is...VW as a whole has a dismal track record for reliability, and is fairly well-known to spend time at the shop, costing consumers for repairs AND maintenance.If these are the only choices, I'd go with the Maxima - known to be pretty reliable (if not the highest in quality), and supposedly pretty fun to drive as well. You have GOT to drive these for yourself before ruling any of them out, but I'd be VERY careful with VW - I know people who have been bummed because of their $2200 repairs at 40,000 miles (was on a VW New Beetle Turbo).

I drive a 2001 Audi S4 sedan which I purchased in 2004. Its been an absolute joy to drive and own, esp considering that I upgraded from a Honda Civic! I wasn't aiming for a high performance car and was looking at the A4, but got a really sweet deal.My concern now is with rising maintainence costs as well as the possibility of turbo's going bad, which are notoriously expensive to repair on the S4. So I'm looking for options to replace my car sometime towards the middle/end of 2007, since it still has a decent resale value.My commute is in the bay area on 101, so its not like I get to drive the car the way its meant to be. Thus, my requirements for the next car are-- only buying used, I've learnt my lesson, there's no point paying the premium for a brand new car. I'm looking for a car at most 2-3 years old.- budget is 15k-20k- want a good mix of performance and luxury. Can't hope to match Audi level interiors but I want to see what my options are.- names which I will not consider - BMW: overpriced brand snobbery, and they're too damn common. Toyota/Lexus: no connection at all to the road, ride is too soft, soulless whales on wheels. American cars: because of reliability/build quality- I do want a good built in navigation system, preferably with voice activation. I keep getting lost all the time in SF and this would really be helpful. - Given my commute and driving, I'm not sure I'll feel the loss of AWD/RWD if I go for FWD. The only time I really get to enjoy the S4 is on freeway merges and passing in high gears. And 250bhp is rather common these days. - again because of the traffic, I'd rather have an Auto/step/triptronic thingy. I wish I could have a true manual transmission mated to electronic shifter which is the best of both worlds, like DSG/F1, but they're not that common. How does CVT compare?- Audi is not exactly a chick magnet , its a bit too understated. BMW is on the other end of the spectrum - flash and yuppiness personified. I'd rather have something which is cool yet tasteful.A few cars which I have in mind are the 2006 Altima, Acura TSX, 2004 Audi A4, Legacy GT. My ideal car would have the Acura TL satnav, Audi's quattro and interiors, 25mpg, reliability of a Honda, and sex appeal of an Aston Martin  Let me know if these are unreasonable demands!

I'm selling my BMW 323i sedan (2000) and buying an IS250 automatic RWD. I'm selling the 323i due to the dreaded collapse of the auto trans that can happen at any time ($5000 repair).I test drove the IS250 - in a word a fantastic car. 18"" wheels without sports suspension, but it handles better than my BMW and incredibly smooth. I only put 8000 mi/yr on a car so I think (hope) that it'll last at least 10 yrs without any major problems.The IS has more than enough power as long as you're not a full-throttle speed demon like the IS350 guys.

My head is spinning. I thought I had it all figured out. I was set to buy the Passat 2.0T. Read Consumer's Report and it was the top pick for performance. I love the way it handles, especially the great turning radius, and it is very comfortable. Just as I was about to plunk down my $$, CR came out with another report and the Passat scored ""poor"" in reliability. Figured I better go back to the drawing board. Drove the 4 cyls in the Accord Acura TSX, and Camry. The Camry XLE doesn't have fold down seats, so that's a negative. The cheaper models do, go figure. But I like the classier interior. Accord is okay, but the interior appointments are a bit cheesy compared to the Passat and it is less stylish IMNSHO. The Acura TSX has a hard ride and is more expensive. I'm stumped. Should I get the car that appeals most to me or heed the CR warning? ",Posts: 2,Member

The TL is nice, but you'll be missing out on most of its warranty, and the feeling of having a brand new car.

I'm moving from China to US and getting my first car in US.

In China, however, Japanese auto-manufacturers are notorious for cutting corners when it comes to safety concerns. For example, they would use rear drum brake which would have been disc brake on the same model sold in Japan.In contrast, in China German auto-manufacturers usually do a good job keeping their safety standards.I'd like to know if the same is more or less true in US -- that it is safer to drive a German car than a comparable Japanese car?

I have a '98 Prelude that is closing in on 200,000 miles so I'll need to replace it sometime soon. I'd like something similar in size, hassle-free reliability like the Prelude, and only two doors. I can afford to spend more this time around, so I'd like something with a few more amenities and a bit more performance. I buy a car about once every 9-10 years, so some excitement, at least initially, would be nice; when I got the Prelude it was a big jump up form my previous car. The Prelude is still quite spirited when pushed.The difficulty is there is just not much out there-BMW 328i, 335iInfiniti G35and at the lower end - Accord V6 MT Coupe I actually test drove a 328xi with auto trans, the four wheel drive and the AT removes any adrenaline rush from it. I was wondering how much better a 328i with MT would be? Would the 335i be worth another $4K? I'm also concerned about the reliability.I've heard mixed things about the G35 and terrible things about the local dealership. It also seems like it's hard to get out the door without a lot of worthless options I would never want.Accord V6 Coupe - would hardly get the blood flowing and seems way too big. Would have bullet proof reliability and would save huge bucks.I would perhaps consider an Audi, but I've heard horrendous things about the quality.So, am I missing any contenders? I'd also appreciate any insight people have with these vehicles.Thanks. ",Posts: 30,Member

I would go with the BMW 335i personally. It is in Porsche territory  when it comes to straight line speed(4.8 seconds 0 to 60) and with the sport package(1600$ option) it handles better than any luxury sedan in this price range. It definitely worth the extra money over the 328 because it will give you a lot more power plus you get xenon and better stereo standard. It is by far the best choice. Test drive the 335, it will blow you away. It just doesn't have any competition in the 40K zone. Plus BMW gives you free maintenance for 4 years 50000 miles. It doesn't get better than that.Audi.... with the 3.2 engine can barely match the performance in the BMW 328, Infiniti is not much more than a disguised Nissan Altima 3.5 and the American Accord ..don't even get me started on that. I owned an Accord(bought it brand new) and it was the WORST car I ever owned my entire life. Bullet proff reliability? I DON'T THINK SO. :mad: ",Posts: 131,Member

Thanks for the input.The 335i would certainly meet my criteria, but in terms of price it's a slippery slope, when you start throwing in things like the sport package for another $1600, which means you need another set of tires and probably wheels for winter which would set me back another ~$700. Still a little uncomfortable with the reliability.Anyway, the G35 coupe is more accurately described as a 350Z with a back seat, which isn't too bad. The complaints I've heard is it's bit unrefined, particularly compared to the 3 series. On the other hand, it would likely be about $7,000 less than a 335i and $2,500 less than a 328i.As far as Honda, I'm sure you can find everyone who has had a bad experience with every kind of car. I can only go by statistics and my personal experience. In 9 years and 191,200 miles I have had zero problems with the Prelude. I had a Toyota before that for 9 years and that was virtually the same. I grew up with a variety of American cars that were constantly breaking down and were basically junk by 80,000 - 90,000 miles. So there's somewhat of a comfort zone with the large Japanese manufacturers.As for BMW, the 3 series has a reasonable reputation, Audi and in recent years MB have been disasters in terms of reliability.Decisions, decisions, decisions..

The 3 series are marginally better compared to the A4 and C class, but they are far, far from being faultproof.To be honest if you want reliability, stay away from any turbocharged/supercharged motors.

Riku,Agree with your view on reliability. IMO, if you want reliability, 3 years and out is the only way. Since you can't maintain/fix your own vehicle as in the past without real expensive diagnostics, the costs are rising each year.Even if you buy relatively new, you should have an exit strategy to limit your warranty/maintenance/repair costs.Let's put it this way: You spend around $40K for a car and it is one with a dreaded defect. If it is a major part like the engine or transmission that must be replaced, do you feel the same about the car after it is repaired? I tend to see this reliability issue with all models for all reasons and the Japanese are starting to slip as well in certain respects. This is no doubt due to the ever higher levels of technology.Parts are designed to last for so long. Remember roll-up windows? Even they broke after awhile.Regards,OW ","Posts: 8,666",Member

Thanks again for the input.Three years, I drive way too many miles for a lease. If I have to buy a new car every three years, I'd be looking at like a Yaris.Good info on turbchargers/superchargers, wasn't really aware of that, though was concerned about an entirely new system from BMW in the first year. From what I've read, 3 series reliability had at least been reasonable (not great) while the latest 7 series has been a disaster. Audi and MB across the board have been bad, though reports are Audi has been doing better lately.In terms of reliability, I can deal with regularly scheduled maintenance and understand that this may be somewhat more frequent and expensive for a higher performance vehicle. What I can't deal with is getting stuck on the side of the road or having the car in the shop for days or weeks on end while they try to figure out what is wrong with it (see the MB and Audi lists of complaints), even if it is under warranty.Just my two cents worth, they should stop trying to throw in more new gadgets that add little to the driving experience and most people don't even want, and focus on doing the core things well and correctly. Consumer Reports gave the previous 5 series the highest ratings they have ever given any car, but are only luke warm on the current model because it is overloaded with garbage like i-drive and adaptive steering that everyone can live better without.

The cars that kept me in the service departments were the supposedly reliable Japanese cars I had, one of the reason ...BRAKES, the notoriously bad Japanese brakes. I needed new rotors at mileage as low as 4000 miles (for the Accord)9000 for Mazda.

I realize you're not going to be convinced otherwise, but check Consumer Reports in the US- the reliability for EVERY Mercedes model sold in the US is either much worse than average or worse than average. The A4 has actually worked its way up to average and the 3 series has consistently been average. The 7 series is much worse than average. The Accord is graded much better than average and the G35 better than average.By the way, CR is not biased against German cars, they recommend or highly recommend several of these models (although none from MB) despite just average reliability, and they consider the previous generation 5 series the finest car ever made.

In Europe these things are not considered ""car problems"".

I have one bit of advice. If you're getting a German car make sure you have a good 7 yr. 100K mi. extended warranty; and by the way, don't keep it after the warranty runs out. You could easily pay in the 8th yr more for repairs than the car is worth.My example: I just sold my 2000 BMW 323i with 54K miles, in mint condition. Reason: Many owners on the BMW forums reveal that this model has a nasty habit of the transmission self-destructing at anything greater than 40K miles. Cost: $5000 minimum, IF you can find the trans. They're failing so fast there is a shortage of these trans. in the U.S. (the trans was made by a GM subsidiary in France; it is not used any more).Rather than be stranded for several months I bought a '07 Lexus IS250 which you should consider (or a IS350 if you're interested in tremendous performance). I personally like the 35 mpg on trips and the performance of the IS250 is completely satisfactory for me. I know Lexus is coming out with a coupe version of the IS; spy pictures I've seen show it to be a great looking auto coming this fall.My son has a '06 BMW 325i sport option w/ manual shift. A tremendously satifying car, drives great, fabulous quality, but I'm sure he will sell it when his warranty runs out.Best of luck in your search. ",Posts: 15,Member

Why all the Honda bashing? For years I have been given a Civic or Accord to drive while my old Audi 200 was at the dealership for scheduled maintenace - it rarely needed repairs.Anyway, I had an Accord for over a month one time (parts for the old Audi were getting hard to come by). After a while, I realized why people buy them: they are competant in every way. They run smoothly, they handle well, the MPG was good, good brakes, etc. Everything about it was competant.But here's the deal - it isn't so much a car as it is a transportation bubble. There was no particular character or feel to it. The Audi was a machine and demanded that you participate in its operation. The Honda was more like sitting in a little shell and watching the world go by as you get from point A to point B. In other words, it's an ideal car for people who are not into cars and driving. And there's nothing wrong with that - Honda doesn't pretend the Accord is anything but reliable transportation.So no reason to bash it - maybe you just desire more from a car than sitting in a moving bubble. I'd certainly buy one for my wife or kids. But for me, I'll stick with Audi and BMW. And maybe Mercedes when I get real old.These German cars are expensive to buy and maintain. If you do maintain them properly, they are very reliable. So if you can't afford to do this, don't buy one.

Thanks all.Actually, the cup holders on the Prelude are pretty miserable; they are right behind the gear shift lever making them pretty unusable with a manual transmission. On the other hand, it actually is a fun car to drive. In that category, the 4 wheel drive 328xi with AT that I test drove didn't offer a whole lot over the Prelude, although it did have a drink warmer/cooler.A 350 IS Coupe with a manual transmission would be almost irresistable. Unfortunately, I don't see it on the horizon.If I limited it to 100,000 miles, it would be about 5 years the way I drive; I'd like to get about 7 years out of my next car but would not throw good money after bad. Realistically, I can afford $40K and the maintenance, I'm just very conflicted about whether this is how I want to spend my money, or how many dollars and potential hassles it's worth to me to have some excitement now and again on otherwise routine trips.

Well, before we went off message here on cup holders etc., I asked the question about whether it was the four wheel drive and AT that sucked some of the life out of the BMW. Our Honda hater made the pitch for the 335i with manual transmission which was helpful. So we still have a spectrum of possibilities and costs.In any event, while the 9 year old Prelude and 328xi with AT have indistinguishable 0-60 times it was obvious that the BMW had a lot more to offer in many regards - the obviously finer appointments and touches, the nice leather, etc, and the very grounded, linear feel - the steering, the power delivery, etc. all felt exactly the same at 20 and 70 mph; but it lacked a visceral feel.

FWIW, the 330xi has 30 ponies more and the passing with the AT is just fine (My Lincoln LS had a 2 second time delay to down shift!!).

I suppose, with unlimited resource of money, there are many other choices. This car, not unlike my first car ever owned, I paid for myself.

I test drove the 328xi AT because that was the only 328 coupe they had. I don't think it had the SP but on the coupe the sport suspension is standard and the SP is only a mild tire and wheel upgrade. I thought the suspension was fine, zero body roll but not jarring.We get some snow and ice here, but it's only usually 5-10 days a year where it's a significant problem; this year there weren't any serious snow days. So to me, I don't think that's enough to justify four wheel drive if it sucks the life out of the car. Others around here seem to disagree, the dealers here have virtually all 328xi's with cold weather package and AT.I'll see if I can find a 328i MT to test drive.By the way, the 330xi is no more, so that's not an option.Thanks all.

The cup-holders are probably the only thing more reliable in a Japanese car vs a German car. I hope your joking about this. As far as Honda and Toyota go, they are basically bullet proof and ""run-forever"" vehicles. The engines last forever. There is no reason your TYPICAL Japanese car can't last 15 years and 300K miles. That is just average for a Honda or Toyota. Your repair bills should be under $1,000 typically, for 300,000 miles on a Japanese car. On a German car... you'll pay thousands and thousands quite regularly even before you hit 100K. However... after 100K who knows. ","Posts: 12,906",Member

I've got a 97 F-150 4wd that obviously won't work economically/mechanically, and need to trade in for something that I can put heavy mileage on (100+/day). I'm looking in the $6-8000 range, and will get mileage reimbursed. What's my best, most reliable option? ",Posts: 1,Member

I will take a Japanese car well over a German car, for the simple fact of the repairs and wear and tear. Japanese cars are known to not only take better wear and tear better, but the repairs are few to none in 3-5 years. I respect all makes, however, I have owned 7 Japanese cars and never once had a problem with any of them, ever. My Acura has over 203,000 miles on it, with no problems. Personal I will always stick with a ""J"" car. ",Posts: 205,Member

I'm getting ready to trade in my wife's 2000 Honda Accord EX which has 180,000 miles on it, for my 2007 G35.The Honda has been bullet-proof.The only expense we have had was the scheduled Timing Belt replacement and I had the Water Pump done at the same time since the mechanic was there anyway. (purely preventative)Total bill was around $400-.Other than that, NOTHING but oil changes and I did the brakes myself.Less than $600 of repairs for 7 years/180,000 miles.It's been a great car.My Toyota Tacoma was just as bullet-proof.

I know statistics show that Japanese are in a league of their own at number 1 in dependability. And some surveys show that the Americans may rank higher than even the Germans, but experience tells me this is not so.My parents' 87 Jetta may have had its fair share of issues and problems, and yes it was quite expensive to repair most of them, but in general, they were minor issues that cost semi-major bucks to fix. Never until 101K miles did the car leave us stranded and in need of a tow truck.With the '95 Dodge we had to call a tow truck 4 times before we hit 65K miles. We had far more MAJOR repairs which were MAJOR bucks. We also had more little knick knack issues and countless rattles galore. Literally, the car felt like it was going to fall apart and you'd be left with a seat and a wheel in your hands with the rest of the car behind you on the pavement if we would have kept it any longer.So, in conclusion, Japanese #1 untouched and bulletproof (except for certain select models which are usually built in the USA; especially for Nissan). Germans #2 - solid, long lasting, well built in general, just mainly electrical issues, expensive to repair.Americans #3 and way behind, simply for the NUMBER of problems and the catastrophic nature of the problems usually encountered. Show signs of ""fall apart"" engineering so that at 3 years and one day or 36,001 miles everything but the powertrain fails. Then the powertrain fails around 65,000 miles.Maintenance.... nonsense. No reason an owner of a Corolla would take better care of their car than the owner of a Cobalt (typically). Furthermore, my friend raped and floored his Corolla all over town and state for years, and never had an issue. Heck, I even acidentally put it in reverse (Auto) at 50 MPH going forward and it kept on ticking (after the engine died and had to be restarted; which it did restart). Ran fine. I get the feeling if I had done the same thing in a Domestic vehicle it would have self destructed in a cloud of dust instantly.  :P :lemon: ","Posts: 12,906",Member

Okay, I'm new to being a car enthusiast, so let me give ya a bit of background. I am 25, and just now starting to get into cars. I am currently driving a 2002 Ford Crown Vic, and absolutely hate it, because of it's size, and seemingly lack of get-up-an-go. The car seems to have no torque to it whatsoever, and it's a bit too smooth of a drive for my taste, so I have decided to get something else.All things considered, I can justify doing up to $35,000 for a new mid sized sedan, which I thought, would give me plenty of options, but I have been doing some test driving, and here is the breakdown on my opinion of things.Nissan Altima 3.5 SE with Premium Package- So far one of my top picks. Has beautiful interior, and speed that I'm looking for. But I've been told by others that there is a lot of reliability issues involved with it, so I'm a bit concerned. For what I'm wanting in it, I've been quoted $28,300.Nissan Altima 2.5 - Surprisingly not bad, considering it's a 4 Cylinder, though as soon as you hit 80, the car seems to hit it's ceiling, but I was impressed it did what it did as well as it did. It's not what I want personally, but shocked at how good it actually was.Acura TSX- Absolutely beautiful interior, but driving around felt like my old 95 Honda Civic 4 Door from when I was in college, just with a bit of a smoother ride. I am honestly shocked by how little I actually enjoyed this, considering that Acura is supposedly a higher end car. Acura TL- Once again, beautiful interior. The performance was a lot better, but the overall size, and performance didn't really impress me for the money. The luxury was really only skin deep, going as far as better plastics on the inside, but no real perceived luxury.VW Passat 3.6L- Surprisingly wonderful. This car was an absolute blast to drive. This is what I was expecting as far as the finer details of driving being nailed. There was immaculate attention paid to every little nuance of the car, and it showed. From the GPS, that showed you the next immediate instruction on the dash without having to take your eyes off the road. To the small umbrella holder that drains the water from it while it's being held. This car was a complete and utter treat, furthering my disappointment in the Pseudo luxury brands I have driven (Acura, Infiniti).My general observation is this. The vast majority of these ""Luxury"" brands, is really nothing more then changing out small bits from the interior. In the case of the Infiniti, a stabalizer control that helps ensure that your tires won't stutter underneath you when you floor it is standard as opposed to optional. I have ridden in a lot of excellent cars in my lifetime, such as BMW M Roadster, M3, M5, Porsche 911 ""95"", Porche Carrera 4s, BMW Z8, and a few others that have seemed to have slipped my mind. I have been looking for something reasonably within my price range that would give me the same thrill of road that those have, without setting me too far out of my budget. Am I looking in the wrong places? Any kind of advice would be wonderful ",Posts: 1,Member

I think that buyers who have Honda budgets should shy away from getting older Euro models for the same price.. In the long run, they cost a lot more.Now, if you had a $30K budget, then buying a $19K BMW out of warranty might be just fine..

About 2 months ago, I went through the same process you are going through now. Simple as it sounds, just pick the one that you like the best. Since I was going to lease for 3 years, I took out long term reliability as a requirement. I picked the car that was most comfortable and fun to drive to me. The ones I evaluated were 328xi, TL, A4, IS250 AWD, and G35x. I ended up selecting the G35x. None of the others really compared. In fairness though, perhaps we should have test drove the 335i or IS350 or TL-S type. We just didn't get around to the other manufacturers for a 2nd round because the G35x also had the best interior IMHO. Having said that, it was really my wife's choice, as it was her car (even though I would have come to the same conclusion). ",Posts: 3,Member

I came to the same conclusion, after reviewing the same cars.I really wanted the TL. It would have looked great in the garage next to my 06 MDX!I drove the IS250 & IS350 IS250 lacked powerIS350 lacked AWDBoth were too smallI looked at the 328xi, didn't drive itThe price, being equipped like my G was WAY moreThere's also questions on BMW reliability Never gave the A4 a lookIt's look is dated and my friend had a 02 1.8T and he seemed to have more than his share of issuesLiked the TL, but it just didn't do it for me personally.Acura really gave me a chance with the car, supplying me with numerous cars to take to work and home, including the Type-S.It just fell short in terms of refinement.But again, that's just me.... It's an awesome car and probably the best car in it's price range.It just didn't give me the ""warm and fuzzies""The G35x was perfect for me.The fit, the interior, the handling, the technology.As for me, the wife had no say at all.It was my decision alone, and she's not driving it. :P (She does like it though) ","Posts: 1,501",Member

Low price, 60k mile warranty, 5-star safety, standard 4-wheel discs, ABS and 6 airbags, lots of pep and an engine capable of delievering well above sticker estimates on the highway (I typically get between 36 and 38 MPG at 75 MPH - a little slower and I've gotten 40 MPG).

I had a different conclusion a couple of years ago. If you see my carspace page, you'll see what I mean.The problem with the judgement call about reliability is all models are subject to issues. Read through the G35 and 3 series problem boards, after reading those I can't understand why a person would want either model. :confuse.In my case I listened to heart, the b to b coverage didn't hurt either.

Yes, it's definitely a judgment call, and I won't argue that Honda has rock solid dependability... the wife's 2000 Accord EX can attribute to that.I also won't argue that BMW, while being the drive with the most ""feel"", suffers from reliabity issues.But watching these boards and choosing a model based on which gets the least gripes is a moronic approach.People post their gripes.Only the true enthusiasts like ourselves come here just to chat about cars, what we like and dislike, etc.Fact of the matter is the past G's had brake issues.The newly redesigned G has corrected this, and in fact, the base G offers larger, more capable brakes than that on the Sport Model Acura TL Typs-S.And, have you read the TL boards, or just the Infiniti/BMW boards?There are just as many gripes there.For me, my final choice came down to the G35x and the Acura TL Type-S.I needed AWD and the G fit my needs perfectly.The engine in the G is on the Ward's Top Ten list... 13 times now. 13 Times.No matter how many times I read it, Honda/Acura is nowhere to be found.Consumer Reports finds both the TL and the new 07 G to be a solid choices.The bottom line is what makes you happier and more comfortable.Reliability, in my eyes... both are solid choices.

I drive a 07 328xi and it's a dream come true to drive, although I believe you'll be hard pressed to find even a used Bimmer at your price range unless it were more than a few years old.

I agree with you on the Acura. I just received the 328xi for my graduation gift and I love love love it. While it might be just a few grand outside your price range (with all the options you'd want especially), the warranty and service plan is worth the upgrade. They are very accommodating and cover everything, including wiper blades, breaks, oil changes, etc... the same things that aren't expensive each time but add up very quickly over time. The Acura is a glorified honda, same engine, same everything... different name. The TL and TSX are both versions of the Accord, except one is 3"" larger the other 3"" smaller. So if you think you'd consider either, go with the Accord and save yourself some bank. I'd nix the Altima and possibly look at a Maxima instead... but I'm weary about Nissan as it is traditionally an economy label. With 35k, you can do a lot these days. If I were in your shoes, I'd scratch every one off the list and look at these:Volvo s40BMW 328xithe entry mercedes (i dont know the numbers)Audi a4All of these base models are about 30k give or take 2k. While the features you may want might up the cost up to 40k, you have to ask yourself which features are most important to you. If what you want is prestige and beauty, I'd chose the BMW. If you want a fully loaded vehicle with luxurious touches, the Volvo might be your best bet. ",Posts: 3,Member

My priorities are reliability and safety, gas mileage and environmental, and comfort in that order. I need at least 130hp to feel able to merge on the highway. I'm most interested in Toyota and Honda due to positive experiences with them (not as much delight with Nissan and Hyundai.)I'm 38 and have twins who are 2-1/2 in large Britax car seats. I drive to work 40 miles round trip five times a week. I drive the kids around 40 miles total on the weekend. We only need four passenger seats. I'm willing to pay $20-$30K for a new sedan. Death ratings of cars put smaller cars at a disadvantage, so Prius pretty much dropped off my list. I want safe and stable, but I'm not a luxury hound. The rear mounted camera on the navigation system is really appealing. I do worry about the kids in the driveway and think that might be worth the investment. So, how important is the rear camera system, and what range of cars is that available on? Should I base my selection on that?My mom has the Lexus ES350 and I admit I really like it - but I just got a similar haircut and don't know if my husband will want me to spend so much to ""copy"" her on that too. I'm not nuts about a minivan, but I started out considering that for the kids. The Sienna or Odyssey are over $30K so I may be able to justify spending more than $30K on a sedan, but not if it's just fluffy luxury.Thanks so much,Cindy ",Posts: 4,Member

The Acura is a glorified honda, same engine, same everything... different nameNot true - this is a statement made by those who didn't compare the Acura to the accord, and just want an easy excuse to dismiss the Acura. I guess if you can't tell the diff between the 2, then you really should go with the Accord.The Acura interior is more luxurious, the handling is like night and day. They are definitely related - just like the Nissan-Infiniti, VW-Audi,* Toyota-Lexus. So there are significant similarities (probably more than with the Nissan-Infinitis), but the similarities are there.*Before someone jumps on my about this, I'm not sure VW & Audi are related companies or just work together on projects, but if you look at the Audi A-line and the VW Passat, you'll easily spot the similarities, and my '01.5 Passat GLX was pretty-much an Audi A-6 with the Audi A-4s V6 engine in it.

Hi all- Hoping to get some advice on the best choice for daily high-speed (75-80mph) long distance 125 mi round trip daily commute. Unfortunately high speed performance as well as fuel economy are significant. Creature comfort is important, with 10-12 hrs logged each week. Should be a mid to large size - (I have a daily passenger) as well as two teenagers on off-hours. I have considered and cannot resolve the hybrid-conventional engine debate - but with 36K per year gas is significant. I was looking at 4 cyl camrys & altima hybrid and non versions but have concerns over highway power - lately have started to think about Aura, Fusion/Milan as well - Mazda 6 is basically out - premium fuel - I'd love the cx-7 otherwise and actually could see getting a cross over - current vehicle is a 2001 caravan 3.8 v6.

It doesn't take much power to cruise at 80 MPH... Any 4-cylinder mid-size can handle that.. Unless your commute is over mountains, or includes multiple sprints from 20-80 MPH, then don't waste your money on a V-6.. Especially at 36K miles/yr... An Accord EX-L 4-cylinder would fit the bill.. Or, a Toyota Camry 4-cyl. ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

Am I correct in thinking that a new vehicle is a better choice? A late model certified with 25k is typical - but the price diff on the better cars - accords, toyos, nissans is minimal and two years I'd have close to 100k again on the odo.

Once again, thanks - It's very helpful to have an objective perspective on this - I am, naturally enough, looking at accord, altima, toyota, and considering aura and focus/milan as possibles - the latter two are attractive price-wise and seem to be getting some decent press - My price performance rankings on the imports would be accord, toyota, altima, (I like the new altima a lot, though I worry a bit about reliability and depreciation) and on the domestics Milan Focus Aura - agree? I don't know where to rank the combined group - the domestics tend to be a few grand cheaper to buy -- do you think they're worth serious consideration in this group.PS Just saw a 2005 altima at a local dealer web site with 7800 mi -may take a closer look...

I'm in a similar situation (shopping for a car, long commute). Still can't decide, but can share what I found out so far:CX-7, forget about it - milage is bad (best at 22) and requires premium, although there is some gossip that it would change to regular for 08Altima Hybrid - doesn't even get close to MPG that you'd expect from a hybridFor your situation Camry Hybrid seems perfect (especially with your yearly milage), plus right now you can get 07 model for about $1000 below MSRP. Another good car is a Passat 2.0t, my wife gets over 32-33 mpg on mostly highway commute. Here in LA they advertise 07 Passats for 4-6k below MSRP (6k for a V6) - that would add to a good deal.

Well, I'm a little nervous about the germans - currently have a 98 passat for my daughter (just rebuilt the top end after a timing belt failure - $2500 - almost but not quite what the thing is worth - the other two kids will have to extract the pay out for me...) and a 98 audi avant - repair costs are out of sight. Hope your wife's passat has a timing chain and not a belt - if not, change it around 80k miles...I tend to agree that the Camry Hybrid looks awfully good - but wonder about the altima - its the same hybrid system licensed in by Nissan but tuned more toward performance - I just didn't think it was that much poorer on mpg. The altima actually turns out to be a lot pricier at the same level of trim, so that's a factor as well. The whole hybrid/gas debate comes down to acquisition cost differential vs expected fuel savings - and high speed driving minimizes the impact of hybrid technology - the gov has a good website fueleconomy.gov and the ""your mileage may vary"" button at the top takes you to the new 2008 window stickers and a conversion tool as well - you can even put in your own city/highway and yearly mileage numbers - I just have a little trouble believing - need to leave work early today, so I will be back on in an hour or so.

I rented a 4-cylinder Focus last month on vacation... While not as smooth, or quite as powerful as the Honda motor, it had no problems with climbing mountains, etc... in Arizona. I was very impressed with the ride, interior comfort and general feeling of stability at high speeds. I was very happy that I rented it. We put about 500 miles on it in five days.I'm not a domestic car fan, so I wouldn't want to speak to longevity, but it sounds like your 50K miles/yr are going to be easy ones.regards,kyfdx ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

It's true that a hybrid's MPG on a highway will be lower, but not much (on camry 37-38 vs 40 in a city). It should still be higher by 7 mpg than a regular 4 cyl. That amounts to close to $1000 savings in a year (with gas @ 3.5, but who knows in a year or two). I though about the camry, but don't drive nearly as much as you do. Also, the carpool stickers in CA are all gone (it would be a factor since I could use a carpool on a way to work). The only thing that would concern me is battery life, since you can easily put 100k on a car in 3 years. I think most of new cars have timing chains now (I believe 06 and 07 Passats do).

Glad to hear you had a good experience with a domestic and yes, the the commmute though long is flat and on well-maintained roads - thanks to global warming, snow, slush, ice and salt are rarer than they once were -hey maybe I should get a Hummer and accelerate the process.I was reading on another forum some just delighted with his Fusion and giddy that it ran about $4k less than a comparable toyota (both v6 btw) So I think I ment to say I was considering the Fusion/Milan twins - Focus is a little light for daily tpke traffic. Speaking of Honda, I believe the entire Accord line is due for a make-over for the 2008 year - more than cosmetics (though sorely overdue imho), the power train will revamped - vcm and probably cvt - so even the non hybrids should be greener. Kinda makes me want to wait til late sept (if my cars will stay out of the shop that long.) Still can't solve the hybrid equation, though. No one likes the altima but me? ",Posts: 11,Member

The battery worries me too - though I wonder since I'm doing mostly highspeed miles if 100K is still 100K as I won't be discharging and recharging the thing as much as in local stop and go service. So maybe it lasts 5-6 years -its still a $3k fix which wipes out a lot of gas savings. I think the difference is significant and that you are right - using the new EPA mileage estimates the cam H comes in at 34mpg vs 24 for the standard 4cyl. On 36k/yr the difference is more like $1500 on $3.00 reg., so over 7 years that comes to $10,500 (at 7% present value =$8,600) - less $3000 for a battery less a $4500 price diff vs a 4cyl xls - I can't figure this, can you?

Point well taken - not that I've ever had enough money to do more than worry about it - I did confirm with Toyo their batteries are now under $1k (the first generation prius replacements were the really expensive ones) and I'll bet they'll get cheaper as production ramps up. So that makes the hybrid a bit more attractive. Btw - not really sure about the green car bit - if we'd stop burning the rain forests, subdividing wildnerness and just impose minimal environmental restraints on cowboy economies in Russia, Eastern Europe, India, SE Asia and China, I have a hunch we could all drive 427 Shelbys to our hearts content. :shades: ",Posts: 11,Member

I like the new altima (except the fake wood trim). I test drove 4 cyl models of accord, camry and altima and altimas is maybe not most refined but feels most powerful (althoug cvt feels weird). As you mentioned all new accord is due this fall (new body and engines), but if you decide to wait - wait for the Accord diesel. Based on specs from Europe it should easily get 35-40 mpg. It should be here sometime next year if we're lucky (price should be about 1k above the 4 cyl - based on a price difference of a new Benz diesel). One important poit - forget about geting the new accord for less than msrp for a first year. ",Posts: 7,Member

Never knew you could get an accord for under msrp  Seems years ago I knew something about advanced diesel technology - that with water injection and some other trick they could be made to run very clean and very efficient - they'd better be because here in the NE diesel is as expensive as mid grade or premium.My question is performance - I still want a car I can jack at 75+ mph and not worry about the sleep-deprived 18 wheeler drifing out of the center lane...Going to go to school on the diesel - but I just hope the old cars hold together while my wife makes up my mind...

I travel to Europe twice a year and actually drove couple of a new generation (common rail injection) diesels. Although power migh not be as high as in gasoline engines, there's more torque than in some V8 engines. They drive nice, don't rev too high (redline about 5000 rpm). Gossip is that the new accord diesel should be 200+ hp , 300+ lbs and get over 35 mpg. You can look at the new Benz engine as a reference although it is a V6 (211 hp, 398 lbs at 1600 rpm and gets 27/37 mpg) - knowing honda, its powerplant will be superior. Also some people suggest that accords diesel will also be a V6. ",Posts: 7,Member

I am having a similar dilima over a Honda Civic and a Elantra Limited. The Civic is a nice enough car no doubt, definately better than than alot of other cars from the competition. At this time im definately leaning towards to elantra.The Elantra Limited has alot more standard equipment that even a Civic LX. Leather interior, Alloy wheels, a roomier car, and a better radio to name a few. I would check the standard equipment at the price point between the cars you are looking at. Cruise was a must for my next car. I was given a better deal on the hyundai here, with a OTD price of roughly $17,000 (including the $1000 rebate). The strongest point for the civic of course is resale value. ",Posts: 26,Member

My lease on a 2004 330i w/ automatic, premium package is up next month. I checked out the new 328i, but wasn't blown away. My options are 1. Keep the 330i. On a 3 year plan, my payments will go up to ~ $680 (I'm currently paying $570 on my 15k, 36 month lease)2. Return the 330i, and lease the 328i. The 328i has 16 inch wheels vs 17"" on the 330i, run flat tires vs regular tires, regular stereo vs HK Logic 7 on the 330i. It does have an ipod input though!What do think is the better option? I love driving my car, and feel it has enough power for me. Does the new 328i offer a similar experience? Same amount of torque at highway speeds? Financially, the 328i lease might work out to < $500 on a 12k, 36 month lease, in the SF Bay area, given what I have read on these forums. ",Posts: 5,Member

If you decide to keep the car you in effect are paying more than you would have if you bought it outright to begin with.The 328 is where the old 330 was. If you want to keep the car for a few years you are better off financing the vehicle rather than leasing.If you want to lease and keep your payments the same, check out the lease rates on a 335.

I believe that active steering option on the 335i might add some help for you at low speeds where the effort might be less. But you will need to test it for yourself to see if it is good for you.Active Steering uses a supplemental, motor-driven gearbox to increase or decrease the amount of assist from the conventional hydraulic power-steering unit. The system is designed to add a level of responsiveness appropriate to the driving situation. In low-speed maneuvers, such as in parking garages, Active Steering ""boosts"" the ratio of standard power-steering assist, meaning the driver does not have to turn the wheel as much as usual.Regards,OW ","Posts: 8,666",Member

Hello:We're new to this board, but are curious which car you'd recommend between the following:New 2007 Acura TL base model with Navigation package.A local dealership is currently offering us the advertised lease deal of $369 a month with $1999 down for 36 months with the Navi as a ""free"" add-on (i.e. current lease offer is as stated above without Navigation and they are including it for the same price).ORA family member is coming off a short-term lease on the 2006 325i. He has many of the upgrades, including the premium package, navigation with blue tooth, power seats, cold weather package, and a few others. He has only put 8500 miles on it (in 2 years) and the lease-end buyout is around $28,000. We can get financing of 5.99% on a $25,000 loan through a credit union and will put up the balance in cash.We plan to keep whichever car for about 3 years.The question isn't as much lease vs. buy as it is which would be considered a better deal, and which car do people prefer? Also, any idea what the resale might be on the BMW in 3 years (we will put a max of 8000 miles per year on it)?We test drove both today and my husband likes the sportyness and responsiveness of the BMW while I like the extra space in the TL. Note that we live in a city (DC) so parking can be difficult, which makes the size of the 325i more appealing.I know we'll be happy with either, but would appreciate any comments/suggestions.Thank you!

If you really want the BMW, then get the BMW.. At first, I thought the Acura would be cheaper over the 3 years, as that is a decent lease deal, but if you are only putting 8K miles/yr on the BMW, you can likely drive it just as cheaply.. You'd be paying for miles you aren't using on the Acura..The only caveat? After 2 years, you'll be out of warranty and free service on the BMW.

I currently have a 2001 dodge durango with the 5.9 motor. I use it mainly for daily driving and towing my dirt bikes to the track or trails. I may be switching jobs soon and will be commuting about 3 times farther than I am right now. Right now I average about 14mpg. I will more than likely be trading the Durango in for something more economical due to gas prices and the longer commute. The problem is I still want to be able to haul 2 adult dirt bikes and occasionally my daughters little 50cc dirt bike. Over all I dont think I will be pulling more than 1200lbs once a month on average. Any suggestions as to which car might best suit my needs.Here is kind of what I'm looking for:25-30mpg avgFront-wheel Drive or all wheel driveAround $12K used with under 40k milesManual trans. preffered but automatic is okmaybe something kinda sporty  ",Posts: 1,Member

Part of your problem is that it will be difficult but not impossible to find something for around 12 K and less than 40,000 miles. How reliable was your Durango? My biggest fear with American is that reliability is suspect. I guess the vehicles I can suggest, would be a Toyota RAV 4 or a Honda CR-V. My best advice forget about sporty, if you can hold on to the Dodge for a little bit longer it might be worth it. Your other option is to find a sedan, maybe a Subaru, wagon, and equip it with a trailer hitch.

We had a VTec 4 cyl Accord EX and yes, it was quick enough, but wasn't a whole lot better on gas than the 6, and made one heck of a racket when the accelerator was floored.It totally depends on your style of driving and what you prefer.I'll say this though...We had the car for 7 years and put 190,000 miles on it, and it never skipped a beat, and never gave us a problem of any kind.Honda can show you scheduled maintenance costs ahead of time so you can compare these costs if you wish, but both are very dependable and I wouldn't worry much about out-of-warranty repairs.

You still didn't really answer my question (I'm assuming it's a Generation 6 model 1999-2001 or so if your Accord was bought new 7 years ago)If so, that's 150 horsepower (about 145 if you go by the new SAE testing procedures for hp). The new Accord EX has 45 more horses (for a total of 190), an extra gear in the transmission, and i-Vtec (more flexible than the basic Vtec motor in the V6 cars). As for racket, well, that's not the 4-cyl talking, that's a lack of sound deadening on Accords in general. The V6 would've made noise too, just a different noise.The absolute best thing for you to do is to drive a new Accord yourself.The new V6 Accord already gets nearly identical mileage to the Gen VI 4-cyl (which gets 23/30 - the new Accord would get 22/32 under the old standard that your car is rated on). Personally, I'm a 20 year old male car enthusiast, and the 166 hp coupled with the five speed Auto is plenty quick (puts a grin on my face when I punch it at 45 on the on-ramp).

I'm looking for a new car and here are the finalists..... I just can't decide which 2008 car would be the best for me. I would appreciate if everyone would rate these following cars as far as quality, resale value, and reliability goes. Just list them in order from the best to the least best. Quality is very important to me before price.Here they are:- 2008 Honda Accord LX (4 door)- 2008 Toyota Camry (4 door)- 2008 Honda Civic EX (4 door)- 2008 Nissa Altima (4 door)- 2008 Mazda3 (4 door)- 2008 Scion tC ",Posts: 4,Member

If quality and reliability are the most important factor, then start with:- 2008 Honda Accord LX (4 door) - 2008 Honda Civic EX (4 door) - 2008 Toyota Camry (4 door)And the 2008 Scion tC can take a close forth.Reading the most recent reliability reports, you may even want to move the Scion to the number 3 slot, behind the two Hondas with the Camry taking forth place.From there, you have to ask yourself what you want from the car.What kind of driving do you do.Do you want something edgy (ain't saying sporty with this lineup) or are you looking for a basic a-b car?Do you want a full size car, or a compact?Reliability, start with the Hondas... they'll never do you wrong.The wife's 00 Accord had 190,000 miles when we traded it in, and that thing still looked and drove like a fairly new car. Never needed anything but oil changes and the timing belt/water pump preventative maintenance.  ","Posts: 1,501",Member

Also it's been out 2 years while the Accord is a new design. And the EX is pretty loaded while the Accord LX is relatively stripped. The Mazda3 is holding its value very well, and like the Civic has an advantage in fuel economy (if you go with the 3i anyway). The tC is an aging model but seems to be high quality and a popular car. I put the Camry fairly low on this list because its quality, especially the interior and the V6's transmission, seems to be slipping. But it historically has held its value pretty well. The Altima is a fine car, IMO better than the Camry if not the Accord, but Nissan doesn't have quite the resale value history as Honda or Toyota.These cars really are much different from each other. You have 3 mid-sized sedans, two compact sedans, and a 2-door. I am surprised that all of these cars meet your needs equally well and now it's just down to quality, reliability, and resale value.

I'm reading with interest the logic others are using in helping you with your decision. You REALLY need to read the Consumer Reports of about 3-4 months ago that compared many of these vehicles. The standout was the Nissan Altima in both the 4 and 6 cylinder formats. I must admit your selections were all different and represent entirely different kinds of vehicles. Personally I bought the V6 Altima, have owned an '07 Camry, I am not a Honda fan but I know they are great cars, just too mellow for me. The civic is too small anyway. The Mazda3 is a great car and can really run, but again the Consumer Reports was much higher with it's ratings on the Altimas. Have fun in your hunt, and remember resale on the Nissans aren't as bad as maybe some have lead you to believe. ",Posts: 97,Member

Gave me numbers I wanted to hear, but the 2.5i is NOTHING compared to a TSX for performance. I took out the 2.5 GT Limited and was amazed. I got them down to $2,500 down and $339 (thats including ALL fee's and taxes) for a fully loaded 5-speed GT Limited. I don't know if I should consider this or now go back to Acura with these numbers for a TL. Problem is that this car is the same length etc. as the TSX. Just the engine is amazing compared.

I recently bought an 08 Honda Accord -- but I, also, was looking at the Acura models. I don't know if this is important to you, but you might consider the fact that the Acura models will be replaced next year with new models. I don't like the ""keeping up with the Jones'"" routine - but I also was unwilling to buy a TL that would look like the old model less than a year after I bought it! With regard to the Subaru's -- great cars -- but make sure you like the transmissions. I do lots of highway driving - and I have always had to dismiss the Subarus because of their transmissions. I don't remember exactly, but they run at well over 3000rpm when cruising at 80mph. I realize the engines are made for high RPM. But, I simply do not like to have the engine spinning so fast when I'm on a flat road. Simply stated, and for reasons beyond just the RPM issue, I don't feel that they are great road machines. They sure are good looking though and, with the exception of some Volvo models, I think they are the best cars ever in snow and ice!  ",Posts: 370,Member

I would go with the Civic if getting great gas mileage is the top concern. You should be able to get 40 MPG easily in the Civic on highway, or 32/33 combined. But then it also depends on the way you drive. As far as stability in windy condition goes, I don't see how going to any of these two vehicles is really going to help. Both the 3 and the Civic are much lighter than the Fusion, so unless something is wrong with your car(suspension, tires maybe?), you probably won't see an improvement in that regard.

No Accord or Camry? (too bad, I keep hearing about great deals on leftover 07 accords)Taurus and Azera are good calls; you just have to think there are good deals on the Taurus out there. Or maybe the Sable variant; how many people can a Mercury dealer have walk through the doors these days? There are oddballs out there, like the Mitsubishi Galant...those look roomy and highly incentivized. A friend has a Saab 9-3...great seats and stellar gas mileage for what it is; he has put over 100k on his with few issues (turbo 4, not the 6). They always have a huge rebate.Saturn Aura? Never see them, so they can't exactly be flying out the door either. Fun game... :shades: ","Posts: 3,007",Member

Remember; ride-comfort and seat comfort, along with highway power are the big issues here! Seems like the Toyota Avalon would be a great fit! It's very comfortable and has plenty of power (268hp) for highway cruise. Or have you thought about the Sonata V6? It's fairly comfortable and has a lot of power too! Plus, you'll be able to get a lot of options for the same price as other vehicles....May I ask why not the Accord? I thought you love your car a lot and the 08 Accord presumably has even better, more comfortable rides and less road noise than the 7th Gen Accords. ",Posts: 95,Member

The Avalon tarted up with options goes right out of their price range. Otherwise, it'd be on the short list already. The Sonata (I mentioned it already, but I think in a different forum ), my folks felt, was trying to be an Accord but failed. They couldn't help but keep comparing it to the Gen 7 Accord and feeling like it was lacking. Good suggestions otherwise! May I ask why not the Accord? I thought you love your car a lot and the 08 Accord presumably has even better, more comfortable rides and less road noise than the 7th Gen Accords. I love mine, but frankly, my dad wasn't impressed by the EX-L 2008 he drove. He had a 2003 and a 2005, and drove them over 100k miles combined. The news one's interior falls a bit short for him, as well as me - too busy looking. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Another car frequently overlooked is the Amanti. It has the same powertrain as the Azera now and has been upgraded quite a bit recently. Looks like it would be a comfortable, roomy cruiser and probably available at big discounts. I peeked into the car at my local auto show the other day and it looked quite nice. Someone next to me remarked, ""Just think, we could have bought this instead of that used Cadillac!"" They seemed impressed, anyway. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Yeah, a fully loaded Avalon probably wouldn't work. But what about the Avalon with touring trim? It's pretty well equipped already, with features like leather seats, auto climatic control, sport-tuned suspension. And according to the Toyota's website, it's listed with a MSRP of 29,325, which is under the 30k requirement you mentioned. Also, assuming you can get the car for around the invoice, that's another $1000~$2000 off. I am by no means mindlessly pushing for the Toyota (Actually I prefer the Accord overall, which is not an option, as you said), but based on your(parents') criteria, the Avalon just seems to be really, really a good fit! Also, how long do your parents plan to keep the car? If resale value is important, going domestic is probably not a very good idea (It's the truth, no offense against domestic vehicles).

This would be a 5-10 year vehicle, I'd think, so resale isn't terribly important, although it's still worth thinking about. The thing to remember is that if you spend less upfront, you lose less. Say in 5 years a $25k Avalon is worth $10k and a $20k Taurus is worth $5k. The same amount has been lost in resale.I'll mention the Avalon Touring to them. My dad drove some friends' Avalon Limited not too long ago and was very impressed with it. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

thegraduate, perhaps you should have your parents test drive the Malibu 2LT for about $23,000. It has everything that you desribed. Incredible good looks-arguably the best of any midsize or fullsize, inside and out. Power (258 bhp, zero to 60 in 6.5 seconds). Extremely quiet--no wind or road noise. Great sound system (210 watts, 2-subwoofers, 8 speakers, 6-disk CD changer, XM satellite radio). All the safety features (ABS, traction control, stability track) including OnStar turn-by-turn navigation system with built-in hands free cell phone.One more thing, if they want leather instead of the suede on the 2LT they can install after-market leather which is much more supple than anything factory installed. That's what we did with our LS and got a $40K look all for under $21K.If they are not smitten with the Malibu, then they are not yet ready to buy. By the way, I drive an Avalon XLS and it does not compare with the Malibu 2LT or LTZ. ","Posts: 2,864",Member

If they aren't smitten over the new Malibu then they aren't ready to buy...I haven't been in the new Malibu, but one pull of the exterior door-handle told me the quality didn't match that of the Honda (the handle on every one I pulled wiggled around up and down, as if made of rubber). Unfortunately Honda doesn't offer what they're looking for at the moment. We're all in Hondas right now, so I guess you could say we're extra sensitve to build quality, as we're used to the best in the business for under $25k (Accords for me and a Civic for them)They haven't given up on a Malibu, but the one quote I got from a local dealer was over $28k BEFORE taxes and fees for an LTZ.

It's just that simple.

The Nissan Altima wins. We are in the market for a new vehicle. Orignally we loved the Altima but started to look everywhere else too. We tried American cars also.But now we have a problem. We want a black car. Nissan and black...eh not the best combo. (I have their black truck - frontier). Now, it gets worse - we want a black car with blond leather interior AND a 4cyl. And I tossed the whole 6 or 4 thing around many many times too...just not worth it after driving the powerful nissan 4 cyl.So - that leaves us with only TWO cars within 400 miles.I've read unbelievable deals regarding the 2.5 s with the sl package, many 1k sub invoice pricing WITH additional percs (all weather mats , etc etc)BOTH cars are scratched. The one is beautiful for the most part with the bumper being scratched very low about 8"" wide with tiny 1cm scratches, about 15 of them. They called and said they buffed most of them out but there are still a few left.The other, their teenaged car washer decided to use the same water he has been using all day with the same rag and dragged the rag all over the car. It's VERY noticable , at least to me. Not to mention, there is some bug gunk that it looks like they couldn't or didn't care to remove. I know that after 4 or 5 washes the car will look like this no matter how much care I take with Nissans VERY soft paint. But do we want to accept this new?The first, they will sell at invoice. The last, they will sell for $200 under. I tried to get them down, they let us walk out ...even when I told them don't expect us to call - please don't lose a sell if someone is interested...go ahead and sell it. We had another car in the game but it's pretty far away and only a little bit better of a deal and is not the exact color she wants.I expected at least a phone call before they closed. Neither called. They know they are the only game on the block and that we will only take black or will just save another 10 k and head into the luxury lines and start this whole buying process over again. (although I don't want to do that, I'm not a big fan of forking over $600 per month on a car payment...we are lookign at only $350 for the Altima as it is)What would you do?

I'm p!ssed.I broke down today and told the dealer nearest to us with the car washed fine imperfections all over that we wanted the car IF they could wash it again properly thus removing the bug goo, dirt on the wheels / front grill etc. And have a detail guy go over it an hit some of the trouble spots.That's all I was asking for.The salesperson calls me back and says his manager is telling him that they no longer are offering me the deal, they don't want to work with me.Yesterday I asked for another measly $100 off which would take this car down to $300 under invoice. They blew us off. Hard. So I'm writing a letter to Nissan. I write them when I have good experiences, but rarely write about the bad ones because I've already moved onto trying to solve the problem at hand. I will however make an exception for these folks. I stopped using their service dept for the same reason, horrible service. I later saw one of the asst service manager guys at another dealer I was doing computer work for, and he said that the owner and manager force their hands to do alot of shady things there. Then you talk to the dealers around and they have NO idea that the CA emissions cars that are being sold in like 19 states now get 1 mpg less! They actually believe the sticker is correct. Those EPA guys already butt heads with the tree huggers, if they labeled the stickers at 1mpg less they would be DEAD. It's fear that is keeping us a nation from moving ahead due to political correctness. Hey I want clean to breath air, but I don't want to be lied to about MPG nor do I want to pay for a hoax which has been disproving in almost every country by scientists far superior to ours that AREN'T being paid off like ours are. *gets off soapbox* ",Posts: 24,Member

I&#146;m looking for a new (to me) ride. I don&#146;t have to decide just now, but probably sometime in the next couple of months. What I am considering is a (probably) pre-owned BMW 325xi (maybe a 330xi if the deal is right, but I&#146;m not too sure I want a turbo), G35x (I have VPP so I might go new for this), Audi A3 or A4 (I like the A3 better but they&#146;re hard to find in the northern IN vicinity), Acura TSX or maybe TL, but it&#146;s larger and I don&#146;t like it as much. I might consider the Altima coupe as well, but not the sedan. While I like the sedan styling more than the Accord or Camry, I don&#146;t like it as much as the Infinity, and the Altima sedans are everywhere. I don&#146;t want to put my car away for the winter, so I prefer all wheel or front wheel drive. That leaves out the Infinity G-coupe (sigh) and the BMW 3 series coupe. I know several people who drive the G coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires. I prefer the security of good winter handling. I haven&#146;t completely ruled out a small SUV or crossover, but after 8 years of driving an Exploder I&#146;m ready for a more responsive ride. I joke about the Explorer, but with the exception of an unfortunate &#147;Bambi&#148; incident :blush: I have never been left stranded. No significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either. It&#146;s just 10 years old and it is time to move on to something else. As long as I&#146;m moving on, I want to add some fun. I won&#146;t be racing or pushing for maximum speed, but I do like the feel of a car that you don&#146;t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve. I suppose I want to feel like I am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle. I would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. I know the Infinity was a new model in 2007 but I like the previous model as well. The BMW was a new model in 2006 and I don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. I might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional cars to consider (or avoid) are welcome. I&#146;m considering a manual in the BMW or A4 but I didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 TL I drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when I lurched on a start). I don&#146;t know if the TSX would be any better. The G35X is only available in an auto. Manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so I probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto BMW or Audi either. Since I&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years. ",Posts: 21,Member

I'm trying to decide what I might get when I'm ready to deal. Here's what I'm interested in: The Honda Fit -- I'm impressed with the amount of interior space in a small space, I like Hondas, and it's different than the ubiquitious Civic. What I worry about most is getting killed in the thing. Honda Civic Hybrid and Civic -- I loved my 95 and 98 Civics and like the idea of owning a Hybrid to get better gas mileage. But I also have read of issues with the Civic Hybrid, and I'm not sure the regular Civic thrills me enough. Prius -- I like the fact that it is different looking, has far more options (and colors) than the Civic Hybrid, and apparently is roomy inside. But I don't think I could get as good a deal as the Civic Hybrid. The car would primarily be a commuter car, but given gas prices, might become the primary car on weekends when my wife, six year old, and I go places. ",Posts: 41,Member

I am looking for a new sedan for my mother. She is 75 years old and is under 5' tall. She is retired and drives mostly around town (busy intersections) but occasionally she will travel distances 4-6 hours. Are there sedans that are gears for senior citizens as well as for a short person. ",Posts: 1,Member

The Ford Taurus SEL is a big, comfortable car that comes well-equipped in base form, and should be had for $20k or so. You can check it out here on Edmunds.com, or at www.fordvehicles.com. No, this isn't the rental-fleet Taurus you remember seeing for years previous! I mention this car specifically because it has ""Command Seating"" that has chair height that is notably higher than most sedans; probably a mix between a minivan and regular sedan in height. It has safe, if not sporty handling, and a compliant, quiet ride. Power pedals are also something she should look into, as they are only a $120 option on this car, I believe. They'll bring the pedals closer to her feet, allowing her to sit further back from the steering wheel, and airbag.It also has a 263 horsepower V6 which isn't quite as smooth as that of an Avalon, but for the price, it delivers excellent power and economy (18/28 EPA) for the money, and should be good for those long trips.I don't know what the budget is here, but this car is a real bargain, and should be inexpensive to maintain.By the way, I have two Hondas, so I'm not a Ford salesman or anything, I just think this would be a car you should consider adding to your (her) list.Take care, and keep us posted! TheGraduate*PS - The Mercury Sable is the same basic car as the Taurus, but offers different styling, if she doesn't like the look of the Taurus. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

I totally advocate avoiding first run models of almost any car with a full redesign. It's just too many things are still being learned during production and affecting all the electronics in the car. They don't usually get things down until the 2nd or 3rd year imho. Now if it's just a freshening, that should be fine, but to me the best time to get a Genesis is probably 2010 or 2011.

Currently interested in purchasing a new car. We've been looking around and talking about it for a while, but have now finally decided to take the plunge. Have a Mustang GT and Grand Cherokee V8 now, and we decided an inexpensive midsize sedan might be nice with gas the way it isReally like the Hyundai Sonata Limited V6 and the Chevrolet Malibu LTZ. What's the pro/cons of each one and what would you recommend? We've pretty much narrowed it down to these two-- not interested in an Accord or Camry. The Fusion's nice, but don't really want to wait until December for the updated one. ",Posts: 10,Member

Malibu pros: styling (subjective), OnStar, made by a U.S. car company, handling(?), acceleration(?)Sonata pros: price, warranty, rear seat room, fuel economy, predicted reliability (Malibu too new to know yet), nav available (but no OnStar)Both are good cars, but only you know your requirements and priorities. If after you drive and evaluate both you like them about equally, then the Sonata's lower price (after incentives) and better warranty might be enough to sway you. Or maybe you just like the way the Malibu looks better and want to be a part of GM's resurgence.  ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If fuel economy, gorgeous styling, two-tone leather seats, OnStar turn-by-turn navigation, confident handling yet suplle ride is an objective then the 6-speed LTZ 4 cylinder is a no-brainer. fuel economy...The Sonata matches the Malibu's (LTZ only) fuel economy, and doesn't require a step-up to the most expensive model to get it the most economical powertrain; the majority of models are stuck with a wide-ratio 4-speed automatic for now, which lowers fuel economy and usable power.styling...Styling is, and always will be subjective. The Malibu is good looking, but so is the Sonata.Two-Tone Leather Seats...See my thoughts on ""styling."" OnStar...The Sonata offers a true Navigation system, with map, and won't require a subscription later, as the Malibu will. Both have their benefits and drawbacks.Handling and ride...From what I hear the Sonata SE has a nice blend of performance and comfort.Sure looks like an awfully tough choice to me!.

Have you considered the Nissan Altima?The Altima seems like a great car-- just not the biggest fan of the interior and exterior look. Nothing wrong with it, just not in my taste.Are you dead-set on the V6 models? A 4-cyl Sonata would probably be similar in acceleration to a 4.7L Grand Cherokee.Not dead set, but the extra power from the V6s would be nice and are still very fuel efficient compared to my current vehicles.Thanks for everyone's advice and help. Personally, I'm pulling towards the Malibu now but according to Hyundai's website I could get a similarly equipped Sonata for thousands less and that keeps me coming back to it. Tough decision...

I'm shopping for a mid-size right now too (and, like you, have an '06 GT). However, after 30 years of watching GM again and again come out with supposedly ""great"" cars that will compete, inevitably they turn out to be dogs. As a result, I simply won't even look at a Malibu.That said, I'm not sure where to turn. The current Camry seems to have its share of issues and I hate the way Toyota packages their options. I've bought many Hondas but dislike the styling, dashboard, and seats in the new Accord. Hyundai seems to have come a long way but the resale scares me and, in spite of more content/lesser price, the Sonata just doesn't strike me as a truly great value. ","Posts: 2,388",Member

If you want you can probably find a Sonata V6 to rent at Hertz et. al.

That would give you a real good feel fo car, to drive it for a few days.I don't know if the new Malibu is available to rent, but if so it would be good to drive both cars for a weekend or so.

Hello,I am a 22 year old from New York City and I am wanting to buy a car. I have been prowling dealerships, but I can't honestly trust someone who is selling me something. I have been looking at an 06' Maxima and a 07' Altima. I don't want to make a decision when there is maybe a better decision to be made. This would be my first car purchase and I want to make the best Decision.I am comfortable with buying a used car and that will most likely be my intended path. I already have been approved for financing through my credit union, but I am only comfortable with financing close to twenty thousand dollars. Also I have a down payment of four thousand-five hundred ready.As I said I am 22, so insurance or insure-ability is a big issue. I don't want a crazy premium or to say I want to know which car has lower or higher premiums. Which car is more reliable as far as repairs and everything. As I have said, I have my eye on a 06 Maxima(Vin:1n4b41e06c801631), but my brother has been raising questions about how it rides and how it has a too heavy for it's suspension appearance. He really thinks I shouldn't get a car period to save my money for something bigger.I need opinions, real world experience, and real data to help in this decision. I am not opposed to getting any manufacturer's car or model. I want something that is a good compromise between Cost, Fuel Economy, Reliability, Insureability, and style.Can you please help me?Thank you, ",Posts: 1,Member

I am about 30 days from buying.Here is my situation and the cars I am considering. I have two kids (6 and 10), live on a steep narrow hill outside of Boston (AWD is needed to get in the garage), have a city drive to work (about 15 miles each way), occassionally have clients in my car, and my wife has a Sequoia.I am looking at the RDX, X3, 9-3 Cross-drive, A3, Volvo 60/80, Cadillac CTS.I know these cars are all over the place, but they are what my research has pointed me to as the best options. I drive a 2000 A6 which I would have loved had it not suffered malfunctions of different varieties over the years. My Audi experience makes the A3 a longshot.Any opinions on the above or are there other cars I should consider? I will likely buy a year-old car and want to spend $30,000 to $35,000 ideally.

well, with a 10-year-old who will only get taller VERY fast and the need to cart clients around, I would think you'd be looking for a roomy backseat. That should knock the A3 and S60 off your list, at the very least.Since you are looking used, although the S80 is a bargain, I wouldn't want the previous generation, personally (and I'm a volvo fan). If you can find an '07 V8 AWD in your pricerange, then by all means, it would be near the top of my shopping list.The mileage in the RDX doesn't impress me for what you get. I wouldn't touch a Saab, personally.So, from your list, that leaves me with the X3 and CTS. I haven't driven either. My wife has driven the X3 and was not impressed. She thought it was OK, but, in her opinion, it lacked in the solid and luxo feel found in the XC90 we wound up buying. Does the CTS come with AWD? I didn't realize it did. In any case, I would definitely want the DI 3.6 engine. ..... edit: just looked it up, the '08 DI caddy can be had with AWD. Good luck finding a used one, though.If I wanted AWD, luxo, and a decent backseat ... I think I'd be looking at an Infiniti M35X or FX35.And you MAY be able to get an '06 530xi in your pricerange, so I'd add that to the list, too. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Is there a reason you've limited it to the luxury brands? You can get a lot of car from the mainstream brands, these days. RonSmith had a good idea as far as checking out the Taurus Limited AWD. You can get a brand new car instead of worrying about who drove your car and how. With the 263hp V6 it is an excellent performer, has best-in-class trunk and interior space. Sync, the voice activated phone and media system is great. Heated Leather Seats with memory function, a DVD player for rear passengers, Navigation, rear parking sensors, and a seating position that puts you higher than other passenger cars all make the Taurus at least worth a look (to me).

Because he wants something more luxurious. ;PSeriously, though, I don't care how nice the new Taurus is compared to the old, you can't make something for nothing. It will never compete in the luxury segment at its current pricepoint. I made the mistake of thinking I could get more for less when I leased a Honda Accord. I eventually discovered there is a reason why it is cheaper than the higher-tier cars I enjoy driving. So my advice is just the opposite. If you are used to and enjoy a higher-class car, do NOT settle for a less expensive new car. You will most likely regret it. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I don't know the person's background that is looking for the luxury brand, which is why I suggested the Ford; they can get luxury features (some that Acura, Saab, etc don't offer) and get one brand new.

First, consider that any stats on long-term reliability on the Elantra are from a different generation of car. Going back to the Gen 3, 2001-6, the reliability is actually quite good. (I've owned two from that generation and had very positive experiences.) So you have to go back to the Gen 2, designed in the early 1990s before Hyundai's big push on quality, to get a car that has not proven highly reliable. Since you've looked at CR, you have probably noticed the Elantra is one of CR's top-ranked small cars (actually is their Top Pick in SE trim) and is Recommended.The main downside to the Accord is that it has 69k miles on it. At that mileage, parts can need replacing at any time--brakes, struts, battery, exhaust system etc. So be sure to have the car thoroughly checked by a mechanic to see if there's anything that might need work soon. There is of course also no warranty on the Accord, but there is still at least 3 years (maybe more, check the in-service date from Carfax) and 30k of factory bumper-to-bumper warranty left on the Elantra.I have been looking around a lot lately at used cars in this price range, roughly $12k. There's a lot of good ones out there at that price, including some 2006-7 loaded Mazda6i Sports (very nice cars and fun to drive) and 2006-7 Sonata GLS I4s, all with low miles. Interestingly, I've found the 2007 Elantras actually are priced higher than some mid-sized cars like the Mazda6 and Sonata, with similar miles. The Sonata has an advantage of ESC too. In fact I am currently trying to decide between a 2006 Mazda6i Sport with 40k miles, a 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatchback with 40k miles (red and pretty hot looking), and a 2007 Sonata GLS I4 with moonroof with 35k miles, all in excellent shape and all for around $12k. The best I've found in a 2007 Elantra is around $12.7k with about 30k miles, for a GLS with moonroof. I am also toying with the idea of getting a 2000 323i that has only 40k miles on it.This is definitely not apples to apples, so it is hard. I won't drive the car much, maybe 7500 miles/year, so the extra FE of a car like the Elantra doesn't mean much to me compared to a car like the Mazda6i or Sonata I4. The Accord is a fine car too, but I'd rather get a newer car under factory warranty than get an older one with more miles.Hope this helps a little. Good luck! ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Very helpful. Thanks.What is FE?  I also won't drive the car that much..which is why $12K is the top of the budget. We hadn't even looked at the Sonata. Mainly because I started looking at Civic, Fit, Matrix. Moved into Elantra and Accord as I looked into features/safety on older models.I like the suggestion of checking out the Sonata. The Mazdas weren't on the list. Safety and reliability in CR didn't compare to Honda. Though, I didn't look into the 6..only the 3. It seems like the prices in my area on the Mazda's are higher than what you are finding. But..I haven't dug too deep.

Fuel economy.The Mazda6 is pretty well regarded by CR, and is in fact Recommended. I encourage you to take one for a spin. They handle great for a mid-sized sedan, and the prices are a lot lower than comparable Accords. For example, I've found a 2006 Mazda6i (I4) that is pretty loaded (17"" rims, ground effects and spoiler, power seat, CD changer, leather wheel with audio controls, 5-speed automatic etc.) for around $12k at 40k miles. I found a similar car that's a 2007 with 27k miles that I think I could get for about $13k with some haggling. Be sure to look for a car with the side bags/curtains--these were optional on the Mazda6 until fairly recently. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The Mazda 6 and Sonata are good choices indeed, and offer more features for the dough than the Honda will; the question will be with whether or not you like them as much, or actually like them more!

But one can test drive the ""applicance"" to know if it is for them. Of course if you don't like the Altima, you shouldn't buy it.

After I got rid of my BMW I bought a new appliance car.X years later I've come to the conclusion, I'm happier with my appliance than I would have been with a 6 year old entry level luxo sedan.

That's fine.That's why there are choices.Plenty of folks (the majority, in fact, as sales numbers indicate) are happy driving appliances.Personally, I know the vehicle I was happiest with for the longest period of time was a entry-luxo sedan I bought used. Bought it 3 years old and kept it till it was 8. Warranty wasn't an issue. HOWEVER, that's me. You make a good point about warranty because when I'm making recommendations to friends and family, I take that into account. If I know the person knows little about cars, drives them without thought to repairs, and does minimal maintenance, then I try to steer them to a new appliance rather than a used luxo-car.Although, if you have a turbo, it doesn't sound to me like you bought an appliance.

If you can wait a few months, you might want to check out the 2009 Elantra Touring 5-door before getting the Spectra. The Touring is a newer design with some advantages over the Spectra, the biggest of which IMO is standard ESC. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I agree with your brother. Save your money. You are NYC so what the heck you need a car for anyway? If you really must have one, I'd get a beater for the cash you have on hand. Its just going to get trashed in the city anyway and you won't need it that much that it needs to be something incredibly reliable. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I want something that is a good compromise between Cost, Fuel Economy, Reliability, Insureability, and style. I agree with previous posts that the most practical thing to do would be to get a car you can pay cash for. You should be able to find a good small economy car for your $4500. The $300+ you save each month in car payments (and extra gas and insurance) because you didn't buy a $20,000 car like a used Maxima can be used for many things, including having some cash on hand for the inevitable repairs an older car will need.However... you said style is important to you. And it is your money. So a compromise would be a small, stylish, economical, reliable, fun-to-drive, and relatively low-cost car such as a used Mazda3i. Other options would be a used Civic coupe or maybe even a Celica (my all-time favorite car from my 20s). Since you are 22, are single (yes?), and live in NYC, a small car would be your best bet vs. something like a Maxima or Altima. You might consider a small hatchback, for their versatility if not their style. You could even pick up a new hatch like a Yaris or Versa for around $13k if you get a stick, or you could get a used Mazda3, Rabbit, Elantra, Matrix/Vibe etc. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Yes, but for a 22 year old who probably won't be driving the car in town much (due to great public transport in NYC), a stick might be fine. I've seen lots of taxi drivers with sticks in the congested cities of Europe and Asia, and they seem to handle the sticks with no problem in that kind of environment. It's a way to save some bucks--up front, and on gas (especially in town), and on maintenance down the road. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

We currently have a 2004 Audi A4 and a 1999 Jetta GLS TDI. We've just recently paid off the Audi and the Jetta is in need of a new clutch, new brakes, and it tends to stall or not start with increasing regularity. So, my wife is going to take the Audi and I'm going to get a new car that will mostly be used for commuting.I'm considering the Mazda3 hatchback Grand Touring model or the Honda Civic EX-L. Though either would be a step down from my Audi, I'm treating myself to the bells and whistles so I don't feel too deprived :-) I'd like to get the nav system on either one, though it looks like finding models equipped with nav is difficult.Anyone have any thoughts on these two cars?

If you can wait a bit, the 2010 Mazda3 will be out soon and is a re-design with a lot of improvements.If fuel economy is real important to you, the Civic will top the Mazda3 there. But IMO the Mazda3 is more fun to drive, and as a hatchback much more versatile than the Civic. The test drive should help a lot. Be sure to drive the cars over the roads you would normally commute on. I've found both cars have quite a bit of road noise, probably moreso on the Mazda3 with the low-profile tires. I recently drove a 3 for a few days on LA freeways and would describe the ride as ""punishing"".. not pleasant to put up with every day. If you want a quieter ride, you could go for something like the Malibu, or maybe the Accord or Fusion. Camry and Sonata would have softer rides also, but given what you have and are looking at I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be happy with their handling.I am curious why you aren't considering the Rabbit or Jetta this time? Also have you considered getting a portable nav unit? Since the car will be used mostly for commuting, it doesn't seem you would need the nav much. That would reduce the price quite a bit and give you a better choice of cars. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Hi - Thanks for the responses. I hadn't considered the Malibu - perhaps out of some fear of buying a Chevy right now given the state of American auto makers.Yes, I think I probably will look at a portable nav system so that it can be used in both cars. I'm an electronics gadget guy so I think I'm probably compensating for the step down from the Audi with as many gadgets as I can :-)Perhaps I should look more closely at the Rabbit. Frankly, I've been a bit disappointed in the reliability of our Jetta which is probably why I've shied away from them. ",Posts: 3,Member

Hello, I'm new to car buying (I've never done it) and can use some advice. I am 27 and about to buy my first car. I just got my license and am trying to figure out what I can afford and what to get. I've heard that a car payment should not exceed 20% of your monthly salary, so I was thinking a car that costs between $9,000 and $11,000 would be best for me. Hoping for a monthly payment of $200 - $250, these are my choices that are in the same tier.1. post-2006 Honda Civic Coupe2. 2006 Mazda 33. 2005-06 Nissan AltimaAny advice would be great ",Posts: 2,Member

It looks like you could go with either a compact or mid-sized sedan, so here's some other choices in your price range of $10-11k:* 2006-7 Mazda6i* 2005 or 2005.5 VW Jetta (get one VW Certified, with warranty if at all possible)* 2006 Fusion or Milan* 2007-8 Sonata* 2007-8 Optima (but be careful, most do NOT have ABS/ESC)I've seen all of these in your price range, and they are all pretty reliable and safe.If you go with a Civic, try for a 2006+ (I know, hard to find under $11k). They are much improved in crash safety over the pre-2006 Civics, and all trims have ABS standard. A used Mazda3i is a good choice, but be sure it has the optional ABS and side airbag package.

Thanks for the info. I was really leaning towards the Honda when I came across the Mazda3. For some reason, I don't like American cars. Whether it be the style, reputation, or the negative feedback I have gotten from friends, I just don't see myself driving one. Here is a little extra info about my position...I am 27 with a medium-high risk credit score. The most I can honestly afford would be $250 a month. I am worried about insurance, but gas should not be a problem. (I live less than 1 mile from work.) Is it even feasible to get financed for a car that much at a dealer or should I look towards another lender. I have already been turned down by Citibank via www.lendingtree.com and I fear that asking for money I might not get will do more harm than good. My girlfriend told me that dealers will only finance a car that is 5 years old or newer. Is there any truth to that? ",Posts: 2,Member

No, dealers will finance anything they sell as long as your credit is good enough. Credit is tighter these days. The turn-down by Citibank isn't a good sign. But keep trying.If it were me and between a pre-2006 Civic or a 2006 Mazda3, I'd take the Mazda3 in a second. A whole lot more car.Another thought, if you continue to have trouble securing a loan, is wait until you can save enough cash for a decent car. It might not be a $10k car, maybe a $3k car, but it will get you to/from work and on dates with your girlfriend (or maybe she can drive  ). If you have a little cash saved now, you could save enough for such a car in less than a year. As an example of what you could get for that kind of money, my oldest son drives my 2000 626 ES now as his get-to-college car. It has a private-party value of about $3000, has 102k miles on it, but it runs strong, everything works, body and interior are still good.Another route many young people take is to borrow money from parents or relatives. You can give them a higher interest rate than they could get on savings, and you get a car. If you do that, draw up a formal loan agreement though--treat it just as seriously as a bank loan.

Since you live in a place like Minneapolis (I also live in the Twin Cities), maybe you should have bought the Elantra SE with traction control (also electronic stability control).Tires could make a big difference. You might get a good set of winter tires. Also your Hyundai is considerably more powerful than the Protege, with more torque, so you may need to use a lighter foot than you are used to in such conditions. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

backy, to your valid points, one must also consider the ""type"" of snow. (It may not have been an issue in your area.)The most slippery roads we get in CT is when there is rapid accumulation and the temp is freezing +/- about 2 degrees. That's because the snow will start to melt but will then freeze as more snow falls. We had one of those storms about 2 weeks ago. No more than a half inch of snow & cars were sliding all over. There's a bad hill near my house. During that storm there 2 cars facing sideways at the first curve. I turned around and took an alternative route. When the temp has been in the 20's for a sustained period and the roads are colder, I can get up that hill (but it is still an adventure). ","Posts: 1,601",Member

I figured he meant the slippery, packed snow that we often get when the road has been plowed but not down to the pavement. It's more like ice than snow. We've had that a lot on secondary streets this winter. Traction control would help on roads like that, but unless it's a very steep hill a combo of winter tires plus a very light throttle might do, especially if the Protege was able to handle similar conditions. I don't think Proteges of that vintage had traction control. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Traction among tires varies considerably depending on rubber compound and tread design. You can go to tire rack or discount tire and check out tires for your car with tread wear performance, wet and dry braking, traction, etc. Here is a link to what they say about the Kumho original equipment tire. http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/TireTestServlet?tireMake=Kumho&tireModel=Sol- us+KH16&partnum=055HR6KH16V2&vehicleSearch=true&fromCompare1=yes&place=62It is an all season tire = compromise and balance.

Here's a few thoughts on it... often people like the Accord because of its crisp handling, especially when compared to the Camry. And people tend to like the Camry because of its smooth, quiet ride. If this is true in your case, here's some ways to mitigate the difference:* Try the Camry SE, which has sharper handling than the other trims.* Try the Fusion or Milan, which have a nice blend of ride and handling that many people like. Also the Fusion/Milan are rated above Accord and Camry in predicted reliability by Consumer Reports, and they cost quite a bit less in real-world pricing than the Camcord. If you can wait a few weeks, the 2010 Fulan will be out with many updates including more powerful engines and higher fuel economy.* A couple other cars you might check are the 2009 Optima, which also has a nice blend of ride and handling and has excellent predicted reliability, and the Malibu, which has a good ride/handling balance and is rated close to Accord and above Camry in predicted reliability (assumes you don't mind taking a chance on GM at this point).If you will both regularly drive the car, it's important you both like how it drives, for the sake of continued domestic bliss.

At 25, I hope you're making awfully big bucks to be shopping $35,000+ vehicles (and I'm not talking down to ya, I'm 21 and a senior in college  ). Personally, I'd avoid VW/Audi products thanks to their iffy reliability and sky-high maintenance costs. The Dodge does nothing for me either. Have you thought about something like a Mazda 6? Mazdaspeed 3? Honda Civic Si? Personally, I put more than 12,000 miles a year on a car so leasing is out of the question. But, I feel like at the end of paying on a car for X number of years, I'd like to have something to show for it. Leasing feels like renting, to me. You pay and pay, and when the lease is up, you give it back. Not a big fan, personally. Id rather buy something, finance for 4 or so years, and then have no payment for 3 or 4 years and keep the car. By then I'll have 150k-200k miles, and be ready to upgrade. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

If you are really looking for something sporty but practical, and would like to minimize your costs on the car and get the most for your buck, then one good option is a slightly USED Jetta/GTI/GLI (GTI with the hatch being most ""practical""), one that carries the VW Certified warranty or still has factory warranty left, which your VW dealer can extend out if you want piece of mind. From what I've seen you can get a nice VW Certified Jetta 2.5 starting around $12k + T&L, more for a GLI/GTI of course. VW also still has 2.9% financing for 60 months on their Certified cars, I think. I went that route on New Year's Eve on a 2005 Jetta, and added 6 years of bumper-to-bumper warranty (total of 8 years) on it so it will be covered through the time I intend to own it (it's going to my daughter in a few years for school). Total financed was about $14k, that in included the 6 extra years of warranty, all taxes/fees, and a small payoff on my 328Ci. Total payment with the 2.9% financing of $266/mo. Car looks and drives like new, and I don't have to worry about paying for anything other than regular maintenance for 8 years. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

CR recommends the Jetta and Rabbit (i.e. the VWs we are discussing here). They don't recommend cars that have poor reliability as determined by their surveys.Also we aren't talking about the TDI here. And $450 is not unusual for a major service interval done by a dealership these days... sad but true. Another way to state your friend's experience is that he paid $450 for maintenance over the first 40k miles. I don't think that's bad at all. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

It's misleading to call the Altima ""Consumer Reports' #1 car."" The only""#1"" thing about the Altima related to CR is that CR has the Altima 3.5SE ranked at the top of its ""Family Sedans"" grouping at this time, one point above the Accord EX-L and two points above the Camry XLE. But... for CR's Entry-Level Family Sedans category, (i.e. under $25k), the Accord LX-P (MT) edges out the Altima 2.5S by 3 points. More significantly, when it came to picking the overall best Family Sedan, in CR's ""Top Picks"", they chose the Accord over the Altima--mainly because the Accord has standard electronic stability control, which is hard to find (or not available) on most Altimas.But that being said, the Altima is worth a look... as long as ESC is not important to you.

In the first 40,000 miles on my 06 Avalon total routine maintenance was approximately $265.00 (8 oil/filter changes & an air filter.) Recently had the 120,000 mile maintenance done & it came to $495.00. Compare that to the 110,000 mile maintenance cost on a TDI or Jetta. ",Posts: 187,Member

Right on. If you don't insist that your service provider - & I include some independents - provide only what's required by the Mfr. you're going to be taken for a very expensive ride. You need to be familiar with your car's service requirements because the dealer sure isn't going to volunteer this information. ",Posts: 187,Member

I found it tough to get an Altima equipped how I'd want without spending more than the competition when comparably equipped. To get certain features, you pay for expensive packages. Hopefully you can find what you want, otherwise, your getting more features for more money. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

DH and I want to buy a minivan. now it's up for grabs on whether we really need one or not, DS was born recently and we are sort of musing over having another DC in the next year. DH is currently deployed. when he get back in May we get to move from Atlanta to Seattle. We currently have a Honda Civic and a Saturn SL2 both are 2002's or is it 2003... anywho the thing that is given us the most want for getting a minivan now instead of later is the thought of moving cross crountry in a sedan. granted all our stuff will be going by way of moving van. its just the getting of DH, DS, and I to the other side of continent that is a little concerning. if we buy a van we will sell DH's saturnAnywho we have been setting aside money to go towards a minivan for a little since it is something we knew we wanted to get at some point. basically since both out current cars are paid off we been putting aside $300 a month to ""pretend"" we have a payment and eventually use to go towards a down payment.So I suppose the first question I have is when to buy? DH gave me the ability to be able to buy without him and all trusting my judgement and all. I'm okay with that but i prefer not to. Or do I wait till he get back and we try to do it during the two we have in atlanta before we actually move? or do we suck it up and just wait till we get to seattle... or do we just flat out don't get a mini van?The next question is if we get one which one? Our biggest thing is Safety. but after that we don't really know. I suppose cost would be next. we are looking at $300 a month payment... $350 if we really really had to... We are leaning towards new and perhaps a Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyuandai or Nissian. I'd like some comforts: power seat controls, tinted back windows, nothing too fancy. We aren't really fans of the wood looking stuff and prefer cloths seats to what ever the other thing is lol.hmmms not sure what else i can add... but yelp! ",Posts: 3,Member

Yes, I guess we'll have to disagree. But I think we should be comparing apples to apples, e.g. a gas engine Jetta to similar gas engine cars, not a TDI to other gas engine cars.Reviewing the maintenance schedule for my Jetta 2.0 (gas), I don't see much in the way of pricey maintenance needed for well past 50k miles. For example, only one oil change is spec'd every 10k miles. Even if it's synthetic (not required for my car but a good idea), it's not much money. I plan on changing the oil on mine every 5k miles because I put less than 10k miles a year on the car. And I see inspections but not a lot of parts replacements. If a VW dealer charges too much for such basic maintenance, do it yourself (e.g. oil changes and filters) if so inclined, or find some other place to get the work done. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If you want a basic minivan with some convenience features and excellent safety, and spend as little as possible while buying new, the best values on the market today are 2008 Sedonas and Entourages--HUGE rebates and discounts available on those, plus closeout discounts. I have seen advertised prices on Sedonas around $15k. They are not the best minivans on the market but have capable powertrains, decent ride and handling, a good set of convenience features even in the base models, and the 10 year/100k Hyundai/Kia warranty. And they are IIHS Top Safety Picks. Not as good as the Odyssey and Sienna, but maybe $8000+ less.The Chrysler/Dodge minivans are also available at excellent prices now, but I see two big problems with them: 1) a question of how long Chrysler will be around, and 2) IMO the interiors have a cheap appearance, especially on base models. Also I hate the exterior of the 2008+ Chrysler/Dodge vans, and much prefer the previous generation inside and out (in fact I own a 2007 Town & Country LX, bought used last year for $11k). The Chrysler/Dodge vans have Stow-n-Go, but that's about it. As for used... that is another option to consider if you really want to save money. With minivans falling out of favor for many people today, there are excellent deals on slightly-used minivans, which can be had with a Certified warranty. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Do you really want a minivan? The reason I am asking that question is that I feel that a minivan is somewhat overkill for a family of 4. Why not go for a small MPV like a Kia Rondo? Rondo seats 5 or 7 (based on config), has tons of airbags & is very safe. Plus, it is smaller than minivan, making it easier to drive & park.Why not take a look at a Kia Rondo & see if it works for you? It makes a great vehicle as a family carrier. ",Posts: 160,Member

Going with a premium name brand means higher maintenance costs, therefore, less practical.

If its features and power on your list, check out the 3.5SL Altima (95 more horses than the 2.5SL) as well as the Mazda 6 S GT, and it'll be cheaper, roomier, and less expensive to maintain than the C300 you're interested in. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Definitely did not ""drag its mirrors"" and actually took very sharp curves (much sharper than real-word turns) amazingly well for such a big car. And in fact out-handled a CTS I also drove on the same course, and the CTS is supposed to be a better handling car.Anyway, it's about the same size outside as the Altima (but bigger and much more luxurious inside), just a bit more $ than a loaded Altima 3.5, and in the same price ballpark as other cars being considered--but a LOT more power.

As others have stated, the cars on your list are very different. Also, posters have made additional worthy suggestions.

Helping my son make decisions. He will spend $12,000 to 15,000 on a used car. He really likes the Altima and can get a 2006 with mid-high 30,000 miles for about 12k. He can get a 2008 with mid 20,000 mileage for 15k+. These are all pretty entry level cars without upgrades.I vote for the 2008 because it had warranty left on it and comes with lots of airbags and ABS. Some of the 2006's have ABS, but not side airbags. He is 19 and could care less about safety.He will (without a doubt) be putting bigger rims on it, I've herad him mention 20's, 18's minimum. He WILL be putting in a sub, amp and head unit (wants some DVD thing). So there is no point in getting one with upgraded sound and steering wheel controls.This stuff will void out parts of his warranty, right? Making the warranty on the '08 less of an issue.Altima redesigned in 2007? Is that year one to stay away from? I had told him re-design years are usually bad. I have an 06 Murano that is great (really low miles though) and read horror stories on the early model years, that is why I am afraid of the 2007. SHould we be afraid of the '07? 2007 would give him a little warranty...I like the idea of him getting the ""newer"" design for value, but the '06 has a nice price! (most of the cars with good prices are fleet or rentals)OR, he hasn't looked at the Accord. HOw does that compare safety wise, price wise? ",Posts: 190,Member

Accord will run a little more than a comparable-miles Altima. Safety-wise, the Accord got side airbags and standard ABS long before the Altima. The V6s even got standard ESC with the previous generation (in all Accords starting with 2008). But I guess that's a moot point, since you said your son could care less (sic) about safety. If you are able to change his mind on that, you could probably find a nice previous-gen Accord I4 with ABS and SABs under $15k. A V6 might run a little more. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If it were me, I'd go with a 2006-2007 Accord. The bugs were all worked out by then, and 6 Airbags (Head Curtain, Front, and Front Side) with ABS are standard equipment on all models.It received 5-star frontal crash test ratings from the NHTSA (an admirable 4-stars on the side crash test), and a ""Good"" rating on frontal and side crash tests from the IIHS. The fact that this Accord is from the previous generation means it should be somewhat cheaper than if it were a current-generation model. According to Kelley Blue Book, you should be able to get a 2006 Accord LX (4-cylinder, 5-speed Automatic) for $10k-$13k, assuming 60,000 miles. A 2007 Accord LX (4-cylinder, 5-speed Automatic) with 30,000 miles should be in the $13k-$15k range. The 2007 is identical to the 2006.LX models come with the power amenities expected in this price class (PW, PDL, A/C, Auto Up/Down driver's window, keyless entry with remote roll-down windows, 6-speaker CD, Cruise Ctrl, lighted vainity mirrors and glovebox, etc). You aren't paying for the alloy wheels that come on the uplevel EX trim level cars though, something to consider since he'll be getting larger wheels.Hope this helps! ","Posts: 9,731",Member

The '07-'08 Altima and the '06-'07 Accord both have 5-star Frontal crash ratings and 4-5 stars in all other categories. The '06 Altima also has a 5-star Frontal rating, but side impact is only 3-stars. According to Consumer Reports, the '07 Altima is more reliable than the '06, despite being the first year for the redesigned model. The '06/'07 Accord have the highest CR Rating for Reliability (Much Better than Average) and the Altima is 'Better Than Average'.I definitely suggest taking a serious look at the Accord. For '06, they added the 'LXSpecial Edition' model which adds EX's alloy wheels, 6-CD changer and a few misc trim changes. Those SE models and the EX 4-cylinder are the best of the bunch. An LX V6 could also be had for under $15k, if you can find one. I just bought an '07 LX V6 with 22k miles for only $16k. It's a Honda Certified Used Car, so that includes powertrain coverage to 7yrs/100k miles! ",Posts: 801,Member

A few other things I forgot to mention in my previous posting...A lot of late-model Altima 2.5S models are former rental/fleet cars. You don't want to end up with one that's been abused, so it's best to steer clear of them. Honda doesn't sell to rental fleets, but it's still a good idea to pull a Carfax on any car before you buy it!Besides the Altima and Accord, have you (or your son) considered the Ford Fusion? A 2007 (or 2008) model with V6 is well under your $15k budget. They also have a 5-star frontal impact rating and have been very reliable. The V6 isn't quite as powerful as the Altima or Accord's V6, but that could be a very good thing for a 19-yr old.The audio modifications (especially a new head unit) may be an issue. The Altima and Accord have non-standard 'head units' that are integrated into the center control stack. See below- ",Posts: 801,Member

You can buy a brand new Honda Fit or Scion in that price range. New car warranty, latest safety and lots of add-on accessories to customize the car.

I did some looking last night and I'm sure the Altima can be made to fit an aftermarket head unit. The Accord I think can be made to accept it, but not as easily, and doesn't look as good. I think he will lean to the Altima.Therefore, do you think the '07 will be reliable? I guess I should ask on a Nissan specific board. Always leery of new model year.I'd prefer the Honda for the safety rating, but at least I am pushing him toward the '07 and '08 Altima which have more safety features than the '06.Hubby and I just saw the Ford Fusion yesterday in a parking lot and liked it too. Problem is that he has a Taurus that he is dying to get rid of and I don't know if Ford has the image he wants. He wants to get rid of the Taurus because it has integrated climate control and he cannot change the head unit. It CANNOT be done. I'll have to look at the Fusion some more and point it out to him. What year did that come out? Long term reliability is a big question on new designs, isn't it?I know there are smaller cars out there, like the Fit, but I grew up in a bigger is safer household and still hold that belief. I wish he could afford a Maxima! (so does he)We paid half on his very used Taurus and will throw him about $2k toward this one. He is footing the bill for the rest. He goes to college and works A LOT. He will be paying for all his upgrades too, and any increase in insurance. ",Posts: 190,Member

Has anyone gone from a TL to a TSX? I have owned 3 Tls ('00, '04 & currently '07). I am thinking of leasing the 2009 TSX with the tech package. I don't like the look of the new TL but the 2009 TSX reminds me of my current TL. On the test drive, it seems to be fine, maybe even a bit more peppy than the TL and lower speeds. I am thinking of pulling the trigger but I don't want to regret it a few months down the road. I'm thinking of looking at the Accord EX-L V6 but somehow, the idea of going from an Acura to a Honda seems like a step back plus from these forums, it doesn't seem like there will be much of a price difference. Also thinking of the Altima although the wife doesn't like the idea of a Nissan.

I have always told myself that one reason I spend so much time researching cars is because you never know when you'll need to buy a car fast... like if your car is totaled in an accident. OK, I do it because it's fun, but what if I had to buy a car without notice?I have that predicament now. My 2005 Jetta was hit by a guy running a red light this week and was declared a total loss by his insurance company. So I need to buy a car tomorrow because I won't have time for car shopping for the next few weeks after tomorrow due to a heavy work schedule. Since I just went through this process at the end of last year, when I bought the Jetta, I have a pretty good idea which cars I would want to buy. I am relating my thought process here in case it is useful for others facing this decision--and if you are reading this discussion, you probably are facing this decision.Main requirements: Reliable (preferably with manufacturer warranty for at least 2 years); safe (must have 6 airbags, decent crash test scores, and ABS minimum); economical (e.g. I4 engine, no bigger than mid-sized); clean CarFax (not a guarantee, but better than nothing); automatic tranny (more for other drivers in family than for me); power windows/locks/mirrors, remote entry, cruise; good blend of ride and handling (not too firm of a ride, as the roads are bad in my area); styling/color I can live with (e.g. no black cars); and price ceiling of $13k before T&L (could go a bit over that if needed). Would prefer something closer to $10-11k.Plusses: Higher the fuel economy, the better; electronic stability control; moonroof; power seat; ""certified"" car.The Short List (Car / Price before negotiation / Miles / Notes), in general order of preference:2007 Fusion SE / $9k / 37k / Does it have ABS? Why is it so cheap??2008 Milan Premier / $13k / 20k / Loaded car!2008 Mazda6i Sport / $12.4k-12.9k / 14-20k / Several samples available2007 Civic LX Coupe / $12.8k / 41k / How much to certify?2005 Prius / $13.8k / 51k / Looks/drives like new, Pkg 4, good price for a Prius2005 Jetta GLS 2.0 / $11.8k / 25k / Not VW certified (but is certifiable), moonroof2006 Jetta 2.5 / $12k / 49k / VW certified2005 Jetta GL 2.0 / $11.3k / 32k / VW certified2005 Jetta GL 2.0 / $11k / 42k / VW certified2008 Sonata GLS / $10.8k / 39k / Hyundai certified, ESC, moonroofA few others I saw online that were a bit out of my price range but intriguing were a 2007 Accord LX with 15k miles for $14k, a 2006 Accord SE with 25k miles for $13.5k, a 2007 Civic EX coupe with 30k miles for $14k, and a 2008 Civic LX 4-door with only 9k miles for $14k. I might make a play on some of these, see if the price will come down any.My attack plan is to check out the Fusion, Milan and Mazda6s first, since they are all at the same dealer. If the Fusion checks out and has ABS, that could be it. If not, I'll move down the list, trying to negotiate as low as possible on the price (since I have many options and there's more where these came from).In case anyone wonders why the Sonata is so far down the list, given it meets my requirements well and is priced reasonably: I looked at it the other day and it needs a little work (broken driver's mirror, door trim damaged, small hole in rear seat back, smoky interior). Also, it was advertised as pearl white, which I like, but it is actually plain white (which I can live with but am not excited about). It drove fine and the body is pristine, and it has a clean CarFax, so I'd consider it but there's other cars I like better.Got to get to bed so I can hit the dealers first thing in the morning!

Epilogue: I bought a car. However, it was none of the cars on the list I posted earlier. It was a car I found out about this morning, doing another search on the Web before I left for my hunt. So the lesson learned there is, never give up looking until you've handed over the money. But my research paid off I think because I was able to tell the sales rep truthfully that if he did not meet my offer, I would head off to look at all the other cars I had zeroed in on in the $11-12k range.Oh yes... I bought a 2007 Rabbit 6AT, blue, 34k miles, 4 years/40k of VW warranty left (including 2 years of VW Certified warranty). Paid $11,050 + T&L. Got 4.09% for 60 months from Think Mutual Bank (highly recommended for folks in the Twin Cities or Rochester, MN areas--their 48 month rate is 3.99% now). Since this is an upgrade from the car that was totaled (2005 Jetta GL) and I lowered my payment about $80/month, I almost don't mind the knot in my forehead now.  ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The Fusion was introduced in 2006. Although it is a Ford, it is based on the previous generation ('03-'08) Mazda6 platform. My best friend has an '08 Ford Fusion SEL V6 and it it feels more like my Mazda3 than a traditional Ford.Consumer Reports rates the 2006 Fusion as Better Than Average and '07-'08 models Much Better Than Average (Excellent) reliability. The Mazda6 gets similar ratings, especially '06-'08 models. The Fusion and Mazda6 are sportier-looking than the Altima or Accord, IMO. The cars share powertrains- 2.3L 4-cylinder with 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic or 3.0L V6 with 6-speed automatic.The '07 and '08 Altima are rated as Average (4-cyl) to Better Than Average (V6) reliability, so the '07 seems like a safe bet even though it was the first year of the current model. For a 19-yr old, the 4-cylinder is the safest bet...both for safety and insurance cost. The Altima with 175hp 2.5L is among the quickest 4-cylinder sedans. The 270hp 3.5L V6 is more power than I'd want my kid to have! Another consideration with the '07 and newer Altima is the transmission. Instead of a conventional automatic transmission, they have a CVT. To date, the CVTs have had no reliability issues, but there's no long-term, high mileage reliability info yet. If he hasn't driven a CVT-equipped Altima, a thorough test drive is a very good idea. Some folks (myself included) don't care for the CVT's driving characteristics. ",Posts: 801,Member

It's unfortunate that the new TL is so hideous. The last two generations ('99-'03 & '04-'08) were among my favorite cars! I agree that the TSX is much better looking. I'd suggest a long test drive in a TSX before making any decisions. If you have a relationship with a particular Acura dealer, they often will let you take one overnight. If the 4-cylinder has enough power for your driving style, go for it!FYI- the 2010 TSX will be available with a 280hp 3.5L V6, if you aren't in a rush to buy!  ",Posts: 801,Member

See post 1832. I have also read that Acura is coming out with a V6 TSX. Dealer confirmed it when I was trying to get my ovenight test drive. Has anyone been successful in getting an overnight test drive? 2 dealers said no. Maybe I'll try in person this weekend.... ",Posts: 42,Member

oh, i did miss that. Thanks.Wonder why they would do that. I mean, the TL now gets SH-AWD, pretty much making the RL useless, and then they give the TSX a V6. What's the point? The sizes really don't differ all that much. Although, I suppose neither do the 3-series and 5-series. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

The TSX will be getting a 3.5L V6 with 280hp. I presume it's the same engine found in the standard TL. The TL SH-AWD has a 3.7L 305hp, which is the same unit found in the RL. Hopefully, the base model TSX will still have the 201hp 2.4L 4-cylinder.The TSX V6 and the base TL seem redundant....and the TL SH-AWD and RL are also redundant. I'd just dump the hideous TL and drop the RL price a bit! The TSX and RL are gorgeous in comparison to the TL, IMO.I was expecting the 240hp 2.3L Turbo I-4 from the RDX to show up in the TSX instead of the V6. Perhaps it will replace the non-turbo I-4 eventually???The technology and powertrains are near-perfect, just what you'd expect from Honda. But stylistically, Acura has really lost its way....

Have you thought about the 2009 Mazda6? It's not a ""premium"" brand but in the higher trim levels, it looks and drives like one! The mid-level Touring and high-end Grand Touring trim are available on the 4-cylinder (i) and V6 (s) models. You can get cool features like Xenon headlamps, LED tail lights, Blind Spot Monitoring System, rain-sensing wipes, Bluetooth connectivity and Bose Audio system. The Touring models interior is part-leather/part-premium cloth, which is a nice option for those of us who aren't huge fans of leather. Just a thought.  ",Posts: 801,Member

Hi all, there doesn't seem to be a Help Me Choose SUV forum but another CarSpace host sent me this way. We need a car for our 22 year old son who's environmentally conscious, good safety record, and starting a new job. We want quality, reliability, safety and something that doesn't scream old surburbia. He needs an SUV v a sedan since he wants to cart around his dog. We are happy to do used v new. We've been looking at hybrids frist but boy, there just doesn't seem to be a lot options. Scared about the Ford Escape's brake issues, or is that overblown? Don't want the boxy, quirky of the Kia Soul, etc. Shoudl we just be looking at a good, used fuel efficient non-hybrid SUV and if so, what would you recommend? Wouldn't want one any older than a 2007.

Congratulations on your new-to-you VW! I liked your piece on your thought processes in deciding on a car, and I just thought I'd add that another consideration sometimes in deciding what car to get is how many dealers in your area can do the warranty work. Example, there is only about one Volkswagen dealer every 100 miles in Oklahoma, so no matter how much I may like VWs, the lack of VW dealers is a deterrent for me even though there are quite a few late model/off-lease cars on the used market. It's a similar situation here with Hyundai and Kia. Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Honda and Toyota dealers, on the other hand, are almost dime a dozen. Therefore, sometimes it pays to not always go with your first choice for the sake of the convenience of having someone nearby who can service it. ",Posts: 345,Member

Yes, availability of dealer service is definitely an important criterion, especially if the car is still under factory warranty (as mine is). Fortunately, I have one VW dealer five minutes from me and another, the one I bought from, 15 minutes away, plus at least one other within 30 minutes. So that was not an issue for my purchase decision. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Have you looked at the Sportage? Excellent utility for its size, good reliability record, good active and passive safety (not tops in class in crash tests but not too bad either), and attractive pricing. Dealers in my area are offering 2009 Sportages (new) starting at $14k for the I4. Fuel economy is not as good as a hybrid of course, but it will cost a lot less than a new hybrid SUV and it has the benefit of a long factory warranty. I almost bought a Sportage I4 FWD last year, decided to go with a used minivan instead. Its twin is the Tuscon, but I like the Sportage better and the Tucson is being replaced soon by an all-new (and very impressive, based on early pics and info) SUV design. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If you have a long commute, particularly one that is highway-intensive, a hybrid won't be the best option for you, I think. Hybrids shine in the city, where the engine-shut-off abilities, and capabilities to run on electric-only at low speeds, allows city fuel economy to actually supercede that of the highway economy.If it were me, and I wanted to drop $30k - $35k on a near-lux car, I'd be looking at vehicles like a Maxima, an Avalon, or maybe even check out the new Hyundai Genesis. A hybrid on the highway will probably get about 3-5 mpg better than its non-hybrid counterparts (using the Camry Hybrid as an analog there). Not worth the extra dough. If you lived in town, the difference would be closer to 10 mpg, a big difference. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Depending on how many friends you need to transport, I'd either be looking at a small-to-medium SUV that has excellent safety ratings and reliability, e.g. something like a Forester or RAV4 (can seat 7) or CR-V or Santa Fe (can seat 7), or a used vehicle like a Honda Pilot (save the new-car depreciation). If a smaller vehicle would work, there's some really nice smaller wagons like the Matrix/Vibe, Impreza, Rondo, and Mazda5. And of course minivans--really great deals available on those now (especially 1-2 year old ones) as they are not selling all that well, but I think they are a great car for a family (I have a Town & Country).Hard to narrow it down to one ""perfect"" vehicle based on what you have told us. There's so many excellent choices out there. My advice is, pare your list down to a reasonable number of vehicles and start doing test drives to sort them out. Get down to a few you like, and start negotiating. Don't narrow it down to just one ""perfect"" vehicle because you will be at the mercy of the car dealer then. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If you plan to lease again stay away from the American made models, as they depreciate too fast to be good candidates.

You might want to wait a bit if you are interested in the Chevy small SUV, as the Equinox has been redesigned for 2010 and looks like a VERY nice vehicle, from what I saw at my local auto show.

Of course, that was in city driving, right? I don't see how the Civic can be considered as a ""versatile"" vehicle.Speaking of SUVs, though--just read a review in my local paper of the 2010 Equinox. I think it's made in the USA, it's very roomy, versatile of course (big cargo area), and best of all is rated 22/32 mpg with the direct-injection I4 and 6AT. That is comparable to mid-sized sedans and even many smaller cars. Might be worth checking out. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Seating in cars is like dining table seating...choose the table that is right for you 99% of the time. And reflects how you actually live day to day, and not how you dream of living.Would you consider buying a castle-sized dining table to seat 20, just because you have 20 kids in the house once a year for a birthday party? That seems absolutely ridiculous. Would you consider buying a school bus because it would be really convenient for OTHER people and THEIR kids if you would spend YOUR money to drive their kids around? I bought a Honda Fit, base model, automatic, and I'd like to recommend it as an option. I did look around a lot. I was interested in reliability, mpg, pollution, versatility (for the interior), ease of getting in and out of vehicle and getting things in and out of the vehicle. With you and two, each of the children can choose to have ONE friend come along, and that's 5 people, the Fit will handle that quite well. The insurance on the base model is great. The resale on the Sport model is great. You can get a lot of insight into the Honda Fit by reading the Edmunds ongoing blogs:http://blogs.edmunds.com/roadtests/Vehicles/2009-honda-fit-sport/You have their comments and lots of comments from other people below each entry. You want to find the right vehicle for YOU and YOUR family. Not for everyone else. Not for occasional transporting other people or things. If you need a truck once a year, rent one. If you need a passenger van once a year, rent one or call a cab service that has that option. If you are buying something huge, have it delivered. The same way you would treat a birthday party or gathering by making do, or renting things for the day, for the event.Use a common sense approach!

I'm 21, and for my first car I had a 6 year old car with 120k miles on it. While I'm not saying something this old is necessary, I will say that there was some relief on both the part of my parents as well as on my part, because I didn't have to worry about dings, dents, and keeping a new car in new condition. I'm pretty nit-picky about my cars so having something that is worn (not worn out though) was kind-of nice when going to HS football games, local trips to the lake, and simply in the hazards of the parking deck at the mall. I'd skip the ""new"" route; if you can afford a new Corolla, perhaps look at a 2 year old midsize car (Altima, Fusion, Accord, Sonata - Toyotas are too dull for even my grandmother, so I'm thinking your son won't care for it either) . Generally safer than compacts, they don't use much more fuel (my dad's 07 Civic got 37 MPG while following me up the interstate on a 300 mile trip; my '06 2.4L Accord got 35 MPG; we both had cruise control set). Just a few thoughts from someone who was in that position not-too-long ago. By the way; I still have my old '96 Accord. It now has 195k miles on it, and gets used in my job as a courier where fender-benders and parallel parking follies occur... I plan to take it to grad school with me along with my 2006 this fall.

It's true you can save a lot of money buying a slightly used car, or get a much nicer car for the same money as a small car. One advantage of getting a new or nearly-new car is that it will be more likely to have the latest safety features, including good crash protection (6 airbags etc.) and ESC. The 2010 Corolla for example has ESC standard now, as do the 2010 Mazda3, 2009 Jetta/Rabbit, 2009 Impreza and most new mid-sized cars. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

It's possible the Jeep qualifies for the clunker cash. If so, you might be able to go for a new car vs. a used car and still stay under $10k out of pocket before tax and fees. Some decent new cars for a young person in the $13-14k range are the Yaris, Versa, Focus, and Elantra.

 The Elantra Touring, Impreza, and Mazda3 don't have a towing capacity anywhere close to 2000 pounds. Have you considered a small cross-over type SUV, which drives much more like a car than an SUV? For example, the Sportage V6 could be had for under $20k and can tow up to 2000 pounds (the I4 can tow up to 1500). It's quite roomy for up to 5 people. Another option, maybe hard to find new under $20k but there's the used option, is the VW Jetta Sportwagen--it can tow up to 2000 pounds and would definitely handle like a car (because it is). So maybe check out small crossover SUVs ala Sportage and RAV4 V6 (probably have to go used on that one to stay under $20k), or even the Santa Fe, which has big discounts now, and small wagons that can tow (pretty rare) like the Sportwagen.

Thanks backy for your comments. I will take them under consideration. I knew the Mazda doesn't have a towing capacity and believe it's not recommended, but pretty sure the Impreza can tow up to 2000lbs. The Elantra use to be able to tow up to 3000lbs., I believe , with trailer brakes. I saw this on the Edmunds website at one time. You're right that I'd have to go used with the Volkswagens and Toyotas.Do you know much about how the I4 in the Sportage does as far as enough power to pull and carry 5 and what about gas mileage? Do you have or know someone that owns one?Thanks again! ",Posts: 131,Member

The Elantra Touring has a towing capacity of only 750 pounds I think. It is heavier than the sedan but has the same engine. The current Elantra sedan doesn't have the same towing rating as the 2001-2006 Elantra for some reason. The 2009 Impreza 2.5i (the only one available for anything close to $20k) doesn't seem to have a published towing capacity. Where did you see it can tow up to 2000 lbs.?The Sportage V6 has pretty good power for its size, and has a pretty good towing capacity as I mentioned. I've only driven the I4 Sportage and even with only 138 hp (same engine as the Elantra) I thought it moved OK--no barn burner of course. But that was only with 2 people in it, not towing, and not the V6. You might check the Sportage discussion for owner opinions, and for real-world fuel economy numbers. For fuel economy, I think you'd actually do just as well or even better with a larger crossover, such as the Santa Fe or RAV4. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Wow, I wonder what happened to the tow capacity for the Elantras?!! I think where I got the info for the Impreza was based on the fact that it has the same engine as it's bigger cousins: Forester and Outback. I knew they were good for that.The Sportage sounds like the way to go with the v6, anyway. I still think the Santa Fe and RAV4 will be out of my price range, although the Santa Fe would be my best bet to negotiate. Toyota won't budge on the RAV4.Thanks again on your quick reply and info.

It is quite possible to get a new Santa Fe around $20k, e.g. invoice on a GLS with AT and tow hitch is just over $23k, and there's a $2000 rebate now plus dealers are dealing on these. (For example, Fitzmall offers GLSes with AT for under $20k.) You might even be able to find an SE, with the superior powertrain (3.3L V6 + 5AT) for just a bit over $20k (Fitzmall's start at $21.4k). The RAV4 will be higher, but I noticed Fitzmall has new I4 RAV4s starting at just over $20.4k. But those have a towing capacity of only 1500 lbs., with the tow prep package. This is well under list, so it looks like Toyota dealers will budge on the RAV4. Toyota sales are down quite a bit this year.I notice Subaru has pretty low lease payments on the Forester, e.g. $279 for 3 years with nothing down except acquisition fee being offered in my area. That might be another route for you. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I could not seem to get Toyota dealer to nudge much on the prices.... ended up just going with the Costco deal.. and did okay...Comparatively, I just bought a new 2010 Mazda 3 on monday.... I used Edmunds and got quotes from about 7 dealers... told them I was pre-approved and would buy on monday ( end of month, end of quarter ) and would take the best dealer quote. I ended up doing better than Costco program or another program I was considering. Got my new ride for $400 below invoice... Costco was about $200 over invoice.

Hi, I am looking for a luxury sedan. My budget is around $35,000, so I think that leaves me with 2007 models. Things are that are important to me (in order of importance are):1) Comfort (i am 6'5"")2) Reliability3) Safety4) Gadgets (nav system, park assist, backup camera, bluetooth)5) Cost (Buying cost + cost to own)I started out with 6 choices: Infiniti M35, MB E350, Lexus GS350, Acura TL, Audi A6, and BMW 535. Lexus and BMW were knocked out first. Lexus is too small for me, and BMW is all about performance instead of comfort/reliability. My top two choices right now are M35 and E350 (Acura seems to get lower scores than Infiniti, and Audi gets lower scores then MB). What do people think? What I don't like about M35 is that it is a louder/rougher ride than MB. It also carried a lot less prestige then MB. However, it has a lot of options, is cheaper, and has a roomier cabin. MB gets much lower reliability scores and has fewer options, but is a smoother/quieter ride. Also, should I be spending time looking at Acura/Audi or are Infiniti/MB just better options.Thanks ",Posts: 19,Member

Thanks for your input.Prestige is a concern to me, but not a huge one. I would rather have MB instead of Hyundai if all the other parameters are equal, but I would rather have the Hyundai if it is a better car. I was considering genesis, but I heard that it has a poor suspension and is very bumpy on rough roads (comfort is a major concern for me). The reason MB is on my short list despite reliability concerns is that so far it has been the most comfortable car to drive. I thought about getting a CPO MB so the warranty would counter the reliability issues. I will give Genesis another look since I hear a lot of people suggesting it (what about Azera? is Genesis much better?). ",Posts: 19,Member

The Azera is a good car but not in the class of cars you are considering.The best way to find out if the Genesis' suspension is an issue for you is to take one for a long test drive, over a variety of road surfaces.If you like how the MB drives the best, the CPO warranty would minimize the reliability concern.

You should test drive a Cadillac CTS. They seem to be well rated and the interior is excellent. Perhaps even a Chrysler 300. 2009 is the last year for the Lifetime Powertrain Warranty.

Wow, I don't think I could ever come up with a stranger vehicle comparison...In any event, even though it's a Lexus, it's a rather old used one. That being the case, I'd have a mechanic check it over, as you don't know how well the car was maintained. I'd also get a CarFax on it to see if it's been in an accident. Obviously the Lexus won't get the gas mileage of the Impreza, and it requires premium gas. The Impreza will be much better in foul weather and bad roads (rain, snow, gravel, potholes, etc.), thanks to the AWD. Lastly, the Impreza will be more fun to drive (although a stick-shift could be a hassle in town), and is far more practical and flexible in terms of hauling stuff thanks to the 5-door configuration.Bob ","Posts: 19,788",Member

I was looking at a new Subaru Legacy and the dealer nearby was advertising an 06 Lexus 430 (Lexus certified) with 49K mile for $31,000. The Lexus price could probably haggled down a bit but I was surprised that the price was so close to the Legacy. So I started comparing the two. The Lexus has all the premium features (Levinson stereo, navigation, etc.) but no AWD. Lexus also has the 3 year 100K warranty.Now I'm torn - as the Lexus is in very good condition and has a clean CarFax history report.Never thought I would be comparing the two. The Subaru has the better handling but the plush, cushy ride (and quiet) of the Lexus is nice. I must be getting old. ",Posts: 4,Member

For me, I am choosing to go with 2001 Lexus although I could not afford as much as you. I prefer it as it will be better in long run for comfort with bells and whistles plus reliability.

First, decide which car you would enjoy driving more. They will drive much differently, esp. auto vs. stick. If that is not a deciding factor for you, then think about whether you have the extra money to pay for repairs for the Lexus. They are reliable, but it's nearly 9 years old and when parts do break, especially the electronics, they can be very expensive to replace. OTOH, the Impreza has a full warranty for 3 years and powertrain for five years, so no worries about unexpected repairs for awhile.If you live where snow and ice are found, the Impreza offers a huge advantage over the RWD Lexus. Also it has the convenience of a hatchback, which I find comes in very handy. Also easier to park, in all your city driving. (I find some garage spaces are tight even for a compact these days.)

Also, consider financing costs.. Unless you are paying cash, I'd guess that a loan on a 9-yr old car that sells in the teens is going to come with a pretty high interest rate.. I have no doubt that the new Subaru will be cheaper to own, over whatever time period that you want to use... But, if you can afford it (meaning payment, maintenance, fuel, etc.. ), then get whatever you like best. ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

As good as the Lexus is the expense of its Premium fuel requirements shouldn&#146;t be overlooked. Its City MPG is 16 so 10K miles a year at $3.25 is $2,031. For example compare that to the 23 City MPG for a 2010 Subaru Legacy with CVT on Regular at $3.00 is $1,304 per year. The difference is $727 saved each year just in fuel.

You really should be fine going with either vehicle. Both Lexus and Subaru have great reliability.

I'm starting to shop around for a car to replace my 2000 Camaro (V6, 5 speed). It's in good shape actually, only 97k miles on it and the engine is strong...it's just everything around the engine starting to go. Plus I'm ready for a bit more practicality and luggage space!I'm torn between going with something new around the $17-20k mark or going with something slightly used around the $14-15k mark.I think I've decided to go for a sedan type car. But basically I'm looking for:more usable spacedecent gas mileagemore usable spacegood handlingmore usable spaceOn the issue of stick vs. auto, I think I want to stay with a stick. That's what I've been driving for ... lets just say a long time ... and while I've thought about going auto I don't think I can bring myself to do it yet.I have looked around a little bit so far...and spent many hours on edmunds.com the last few weeks. What has really surprised me so far is that for all the talk about cars getting better gas mileage, etc...there are really very very few that average anywhere close to 30 or higher. I mean yeah, the Prius, Insight, Jetta TDI but below that there are an awful lot of cars that sit in the mid 20 mpg range for an average. For reference, the EPA estimates on my Camaro are 17-29 and in my normal commute I average 22. And on straight highway runs I do get 28 or 29 (at an average mph of 70-75).Anyway, mpg aside...I briefly thought about a small SUV (ie. Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4) but after driving the RAV4, I think I've decided against them. They do have space...but they carry a premium price new (well, and used too) and I didn't really care for the handling of the RAV4.While at the Toyo dealership, I also drove a Matrix and Prius. There's no way I'm ready to get used to the way the Prius drives. The Matrix is maybe a possibility but I wasn't crazy about the way it handled either. It was just numb...no feedback.The other two cars I've driven so far are a Mazda 3s sedan and VW Jetta TDI (w/DSG). Both of those I liked much more than the Toyotas...handling! But they were both autos, so I need to go back and drive the MT versions.So, the new cars on my list right now are:Mazda 3 sedanMazda 3 hatchbackVW Jetta SEand as a stretch, the VW Jetta TDI(I liked the TDI I test drove, but...1 it's over the top of my $$$ range (but there is that tax credit thing), 2 high demand so little movement on price, 3 is it worth it since I only average about 12k miles a year?, 4 I don't really know how much maintenance would cost for the VW but I'm assuming more than some other models)As for some other popular models...since I plan to keep the car for 8-10 years, if I can't stand to spend one day looking at a car, then it's off the list...ie., the current model Honda Accord and Civic, the Corolla, the Ford Focus all fall into this category.So, given all I mention above:1. Is there any other ""new"" car I should seriously take a look at? 2. What ""used"" cars should I consider?Luckily, my Camaro is still running good enough that I'm not in any particular rush...I have time to look around. ",Posts: 31,Member

Since you mentioned ""more usable space"" three times, you might look at some other small hatches/wagons. The Elantra Touring is roomier than the Mazda3s, but the engine is less powerful and handling not as crisp. But it has a smoother ride, is roomier, has better fuel economy, costs less, and did I mention it's roomier?Others to check include the Impreza wagon (FE not as good as the FWD cars, but nice little wagon and has AWD.If you like the Jetta, did you look at the Sport Wagon? Much more space than the sedan. Also the Rabbit would be more versatile than the Jetta.You should also look at some mid-sized sedans that fall under $20k with a stick, such as the Fusion (really nice blend of ride and handling), Sonata SE I4 (has sport-tuned suspension so it's crisper than the normal Sonata), and Optima LX. Lots of room in those. And they get excellent FE for such large cars, as good as many compacts. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Since you mentioned ""more usable space"" three timesYeah, coming from the Camaro, usable space is important. The only somewhat flat surface you get for luggage in the Camaro is the rear deck or the back seat folded down. The cargo area is just a place to put the T-Top panels. Realistically, the trunk area in most sedans will be wonderful. At first I was going a little overboard in favor of SUV and hatchback models, but really, 99.9% of the time a trunk will be plenty. That said, I did notice that the trunk opening on the Mazda 3 sedan is kind of narrow? Because the rear glass comes so far back, there is no way to 'indent' the top opening of the trunk so it is more narrow than on some other cars.I did think about the Jetta Sport Wagon but the dealers in my area have none right now...not sure when they will get any...and again, realistically I don't really need that type of layout. Single, no kids :>I did have a friend mention the Ford Fusion, so I may check that one out. I looked at pics of the Elantra Touring but have not seen in person. The exterior doesn't really grab me but I may drive by a dealer for a quick look.Thanks! ",Posts: 31,Member

Recognize that buying any used car is buying 'as-is'. A mechanical/electrical problem that may be hidden, could add thousands of dollars of cost to repair. BEFORE purchase of any used vehicle, you need to pay to have an independent mechanic check it out and give you an indication of what is wrong. This may cost $100 or so, but could highlight problems that you would have no clue might exist. Even then, there still could be hidden defects.Buying something 3 hours away, makes it even more difficult to do a sales transaction, or any followup. Personally, I wouldn't be buying a used car 3 hours away. I've always had the perception, that people don't usually get rid of cars that are running perfect. They get rid of cars that they don't want to spend any more money fixing it up. Sometimes the repair bills are more than the vehicle is worth, so they decide to dump it. As a buyer, one always thinks the car looks perfect....but I think you should plan for the fact that the vehicle has problems. You just hope that the problems are cheaper and easier to fix....as opposed to a more expensive engine or transmission problem. Has the vehicle been wrecked?I'd recommend shifting your focus from the fact that the vehicle has all the features you want, to how mechanically sound, safe, and reliable is the vehicle. And then how much more money is at risk for repairs: - new brakes and rotors?- new struts, shocks, alignment?- new tires ?- new CV axles/joints needed?- engine timing belt/water pump due for replacement? (don't take someone's word this was done, unless you see an actual receipt. This can be 750 - 1K to do).- oxygen sensor / catalytic converter problems?- engine condition ?- transmission condition ? - air conditioner condition ?- all door windows and locks work?Repairs can be multiple hundreds to thousands of dollars, get it checked BEFORE you buy anything.

I've always had the perception, that people don't usually get rid of cars that are running perfect. They get rid of cars that they don't want to spend any more money fixing it up.Do you really mean that the way it reads? It reads as if you think every used car needs repairs. I can't imagine you really believe that. I've bought and sold cars that needed nothing whatsoever at the time or in the immediate future.I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, you mean to say you go into a used car purchase with the preconceived notion that it needs repairs. Depending on the car, age, and mileage, I would agree with you in that case. one example would be the last used car I bought. I got it home and would not even drive it until after I replaced the timing belt, tensioner, water pump, thermostat, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, and all fluids. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Camry SE has more horse power. It's just like top Accord V6 compared to smaller I4 Accord. It's matter of money and horse power difference. No, its not. The SE 4-cylinder Camry has a negligible horsepower increase in 4-cyl models (10 horses) while the difference in the (I-4 Accord and V6 Accord is over 80 horses). I'd bet money that if you notice a difference in the SE Camry engine and LE/XLE Camry engine, its a negligible one in 4-cylinder models. The V6 models have the exact same power output in all Camry models.The SE Camry will ride firmer and handle better than the LE and XLE models. How you like that difference is something that will only be solved by a test drive by you, tomken. Happy shopping! ","Posts: 9,731",Member

I should consider myself lucky. I can understand your concerns. I bought an 04' LS430 Ultra in 2007, and recently bought an 05' WRX to replace an 03' Toyota Avalon. The Avalon was too much like the Lexus, plus I needed something fun and powerful. Now that I have the Subaru.......Both the Lexus and Subaru have given me the ability to significantly switch driving experiences whenever it suits me.  Winters coming , so I'll have my 1st opportunity to see how the Sub handles in the snow. If that becomes a problem, I also have an 02' Dodge Dakota 4x4 as a back-up. My Lexus and my Subaru each offer different conveniences and driving experiences. Because of that fact, having both, helps me to appreciate each car individually. For instance, I could never take my Subaru on a long drive and expect to be as comfortable as I'd be in the Lexus. On the other hand, whenever I drive into NYC or congested areas, the Subarus power,handling/agility,ease of parking, is fantastic. BTW all of the vehicles I mentioned were purchased from a dealer only auction. I saved thousands of dollars doing it this way instead of going to a dealers lot to pay their huge markup.

Third Acura I've bought. Almost bought a MBenz C350. Drove a 2008 E Class 350 with 14k miles on it today. Couldn't believe how heavy it felt and how many little rattles it had and how rough it rode on the highway. In all fairness, maybe a tire was out of balance. Car looked great but didn't have near the zip of the TSX. My wife's 2007 MDX with 39K on the clock is absolutely perfect and feels like a new car. That's what did it for me. The door shuts with a very quality ""Thud"". I was able to get a great deal on the TSX with 2.9% financing and it's got to be one of the least expensive cars to own - especially with a deal below invoice. I had to sell my 2007 TSX which was perfect that I had bought new when I had to go to a company car. Took me about 1 week on Craig's List to find a buyer.

My parents are soon to be in the market for a new car. They really need to consider visibility, reliability, size and safety. They really hate visiting dealers to check out vehicles and I'm far away from them so can't help out by taking them around. So, I'd like to help narrow the search to maybe 2 cars.As for safety and size, they aren't comfortable in a small car for safety reasons and they can't handle a large car so mid-size is it. They would like something that can accelerate at least as fast as their 2000 Camry, which is a 6 cylinder and has about 200 hp. A 4 cylinder is fine if it can accelerate this fast or close.They are both around 5' tall and have trouble backing up in their current vehicle because the back seat is high for them to see over. They aren't good at using the side mirrors so looking back over their shoulder through the rear window is necessary. If it helps you, their previous car was a '94 Plymouth Acclaim and my mom still talks about the great visibility in that car. Cars designs these days seem to sacrifice visibility but perhaps there are some that aren't as bad as others.Thanks for your input! ",Posts: 88,Member

What kind of ride do they like? Soft, or firmer? What is their price range? If it's in the low-mid $20s, they might check out the 2011 Sonata, which has 198 hp and a backup camera with the nav system, could probably get one for around $25k or so. The Accord EX also has good power, but I don't know if it has a backup camera. Both of these cars have ""large car"" interiors, but the Accord has a more comfortable rear seat IMO. Both are safe with all the key safety features and excellent crash test scores, and have a very good reliability record (although the 2011 Sonata is a new design; the previous generation was reliable).

I consider the current Accord to be a large car, personally. Even the previous gen was ""too big"" IMHO.I'm going to suggest the Legacy. It is the runt of the mid-sizers and offers the added safety of AWD. In non-turbo guise, it is a bit down on power at 170hp, but I don't think they'll miss it once they experience the CVT and AWD. Not to mention the far better gas mileage than their '00 Camry. And, if so inclined, they could always try on the turbo or 6-cyl for size. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

So my 2000 Camaro is 10 yrs old and over the last 2 yrs I've put better than $5000 in repairs and maintenance into it. It's good for the moment, and I am likely to keep it as a second car, but am now shopping for a new daily driver. My commute is 14 miles each way and I am averaging only 11k miles per year (the Camaro is only now at 102k).I've test driven a couple cars and spent lots of time on pics and reviews. At first I was having a hard time narrowing it down to sedan or compact SUV. But basically, a sedan is fine for me and if I were buying new, right now, I'd be choosing between a 2011 Hyundai Sonata SE, 2010 VW Jetta TDI, or 2010 VW Jetta Wolfsburg.However, given I haven't had a car payment for several years now, the payment that comes with one of those cars hurts a little bit. So, I'm at least thinking about buying something slightly used for a bit cheaper.Right now on my list is a 2008-2009 VW Rabbit, 2008-2009 VW Jetta, 2008+ Ford Fusion. Looking for feedback on these or other suggestions. I've driven a Toyota Matrix but didn't love the ""feel"" of it and don't want a Camry. I don't want a Honda Civic or Accord. I haven't looked at recent Chevy Malibu or Impala. What else would be a good bet? What will likely last relatively trouble free? ",Posts: 31,Member

I'm looking at the '11 Sonata for myself and would like to give my '06 Sonata to them but they won't be able to see well enough out of either of these, especially the '11. And there's no way they can operate a NAV! The Accord looks like the visibility will be better, especially if the driver's seat can be raised quite a bit.

I could probably score a deal on a base model of either one near the top of my price range.

I would verify that the owner has a clear title and would recommend that you have the vehicle inspected by a professional to verify that the car does not have any mechanical problems, been in an accident or gone through a flood. The black book trade in value for the base 4 door Altima with auto is somewhere around $11,245 so if this is indeed an up and up deal it's a steal, just be very careful that it's not one of those too good to be true type of deal.

If this car is as good as the seller says it is, he could bring it to Nissan dealership and walk out with a lot more than $2800 cash. So something seems VERY fishy here. I've heard of cases where a divorced person sold a car or other asset of their spouse at a ridiculously low price out of spite. I wonder if that is going on here... ","Posts: 18,946",Member

They claim that the title is free and clear in their name ... I say 'they' because, I've wrote to a few of these ads, and am getting back replies, that sound similar, I hate to say. Bummer! I had a suspicion, it was too good to be true... there's not just one or two at this price, there are many. The stories I'm hearing of why they're selling, are somewhat in the same 'groove'. I'm going to Iraq, my wife is leaving me, I have personal problems ... etc. etc.These are being found in my local paper, and I'm surprised and angry, that they're allowing scams to be run ... today I'm going to talk to someone at the newspaper.Tell me though: do any of you know, just where do they get these cars? Or are there really NO cars at all, and the scam is, to get your money? I can't imagine, that there's really any car at all, because there's no way, they would have ALL these cars for those prices.Oh .. and here's a website, the last person linked in her e-mail: http://www.expertadls.com/She told me that this company is handling the deal.

OK, so I went and looked at some cars on a local car dealer's lot. The cars have a Free Carfax Vehicle History Report and a clean title guarantee. 3 month or 3,000 miles warranty, or they have extended warranty service plans.There are two cars there, that I feel are pretty good deals, but have some hesitations. 1. 2002 Saturn SL1, 28,000 miles: $5,900 - it's in excellent condition, outside and in. I haven't test drove it yet ... might today. Blue book for that is: $5,100. I researched it a bit online, saw that they had problems with that year ... leaking oil, and even when repaired, the seal doesn't hold. Uses lots of oil also. Do you guys know anything about that?2. 2001 Nissan Altima, 62,000 miles: $6,400 - also in excellent condition. Blue book: $6,800.It's under BB value ... so that's a good thing BUT, I read that the engines can catch on fire, or at least some of them ... and trouble with the intake manifold gasket ... also valve cover gasket.So .. that's down the road from me. I might test them today and ask a few questions of the dealer.Any thoughts on those two? Sure hope you guys don't get tired of me... LOL .. I'm really scared that I'll get stuck with a lemon, and I just can't afford to. Thanks again,Diana ",Posts: 26,Member

No car at all..it's a pure scam.They get the pictures from some other ad on the internet.. You can submit an ad to your local paper on-line. Plus, almost all local papers are hooked up with Cars.com for their ads. That doesn't make it legitimate. Chances are this is some kid in Nigeria... As mentioned above, if someone really had a $10K car that they just wanted to get rid of fast, they'd walk into a Nissan dealer and walk out with a check in 30 minutes.. They wouldn't take out an ad to sell it for $2800.In the car business, you can make a good deal, but you aren't going to steal a car for 1/2 its value.regards,kyfdx ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

It is good that you are doing your research. I have also been scared off the Altima not long ago, so I know what you are referring to. It is probably best just to forget that car.And, yes, it looks like the SL has head gasket issues. Also something I would not want to mess with if I were you.It sounds like you are looking for any decent mid-sized car. I suggest a Mazda6i (4-cyl model). There are some reports of timing chain failure on the '03s, but I don't see the same complaints on the '04+ years.You may also want to look for an '03+ Elantra. Those seem to have good reliability, too, and are cheap cheap to buy. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Unfortunately, the word has gotten out about how good the Gen 3 Elantras are, and their prices are going up steadily. The value of my 2004 GT has actually increased over the past year. It might be possible to find a good sample under $6k, but it will likely have lots of miles and no ABS. I finally gave up on my search for a reasonably priced used car like an Elantra and went the lease route, $179/mo for 39 mos. a 2010 Sentra 2.0S. Payments are about the same if I bought a $6k car, paid all the taxes and fees, and financed it over 4 years. And no worries about unexpected expenses. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I drive a '96 Accord 4-cylinder 52 miles round-trip to work each day. It now has 210k miles. I've spent around $300/year on repair; usually one component simply gets old and starts to have a problem. The only time I was left stranded by it was when I noticed my radiator had a tiny hairline-crack and miniscule leak, so I had it replaced; the dealer didn't properly clamp a hose and all my coolant ran out on I-59 in Birmingham. In July. During afternoon rush-hour. It was a rough afternoon! Overall though, I'd trust the car to take me to the beach. The A/C still blows cold, I use the cruise control daily, and have a rear power-door lock that doesn't work. Beyond that, the car doesn't even have a rattle, and brings right at 30 MPG if I keep my highway speed at 70 or under. Does that mean everyone has had such good luck with high-mileage Accords? No, but it seems that the older the Accord, the more reliable they tended to be. I have a 2006 Accord with 60k miles on it, but still love my old '96 as the daily driver; I got it in 2002 with 120k miels on it and developed a ""connection"" with it. I'll drive it until the wheels fall off, but that this point, I could be driving it for awhile! ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Just be aware that when buying a 10+ year old car with 100k+ miles on it, that you will indeed have things that start breaking, minor and major. I'd not buy a car with that many years or miles without planning on $300-$400 a year for things to fail. The Civics and Accords of the same Vintage should prove equally reliable/dependable. My grandparents have a '97 Civic LX with 145k miles on it, and have replaced the catalytic converter ($700) but not anything else that I'm aware of. I drive them in it occasionally; still does just fine, but it definitely won't have the same power your Concorde does. 32-35 MPG in regular driving has its price.  ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Hi all,I am in the market for buying a used Honda Accord (2005 - 2007) for about < 13,000. I am rather new to the US and have some questions for people who have used Honda Accord buying experience.1) How negotiable is the price at a dealership. I understand that Honda Accords are reliable cars and have good resale value and in high demand. Is is possible to do some negotiations over the price at dealerships. Also how risky is it buying a used car without any warranty ?2) I am based in Minneapolis,MN. Do dealerships here allow pre sales car inspection , i.e., can I take the car to an independent mechanic for inspection before I pay.Any recent experience that anybody can share will in this regard be greatly appreciated.

My wife has the suv now in the family for the kids (2010 Mazda CX-9).I want to stay in the sedan family or very small suv as I feel we need 1 car in family that gets 25-30 mpg. I was considering the Prius, Accord & Altima. I believe my budget for leasing is an msrp between 25k-28k.I was going to go Prius, but trunk will not hold our stroller, if we ever take that car as we would have 2 car seats for the kids.I feel like the Accord and Altima similar to what I drive now, just another car, and I like excitement and like to mix things up, thats why I do not want another Camry. The New Hyundai is nice, but locally they will not do much better than msrp. I wish I could buy instead of lease, but I cannot afford payments to be more than $375 and do not have more than $1k to put down. I have excellent credit.I feel that I am restricted as at that msrp range, I am losing Nav that I have now and some silly options like dual power seats.Anyone have any recommendations on something in that range that is comfy, good size trunk and has Leather, Bluetooth and Satellite radio at least.Please help and thank you ",Posts: 7,Member

I'd buy a less-expensive pre-owned car (a 2009-10 Sonata with low miles can be had for $10k-$15k depending on trim and how many miles); break that habit of leasing. You can get them with heated leather, bluetooth, Satellite, and they have a very large trunk. It'll be under warranty, has an excellent safety record, and should meet your other requirements for now. At 7% interest, you'd have payments of $360/mo for 4 years on a $15,000 car with nothing down. After that 4 years you still have a car, no payments to make, and time to save for your next purchased vehicle.Just telling you what I'd do. We're all here to share opinions, right?

Good thinking. Actually, for someone with excellent credit (as stated), the picture is even better than that. My bank will do 4.29% for 60 months on a new or late-model used car, and with that, a $16k loan (assume a really nice, loaded, low miles 2009-10 Sonata with $1000 down) is just under $300 a month. Well within the budget. Might be able to work something similar on a slightly used Fusion/Milan (which are very nice also). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Hi, I just took a drive in a 2006 is 250 that my nephew is thinking of taking the lease of over. This car looked like it was still in the show room. I've never driven a Lexus of any type before so I was surprised at the noise/feeling I got from the car. It's hard to explain but when I turned it on a heard low rumbling kind of sound and even said to the guy if the engine always sounded like this, he said yes. When I drove it this sound seemed to get worse. It wasn't a nice throaty sports car sound. It didn't seem to effect the feel of the car or performance of it. So I was wondering if people who have this car (it is a sports version of it I'm told) could say if this is because of the more sports setup and could be the mufflers or something like that? I told my nephew I wouldn't buy it with the sound without having it checked out. If it was new and had this sound I wouldn't buy it.Sorry I couldn't explain the sound/feel better but just wondering if this car is like that.Pat. ",Posts: 2,Member

I'm trying to decide between 4 cylinder versions of the 2011 Malibu LTZ and 2011 Fusion SEL. After rebates and GM card incentives on the Malibu the Fusion is about $400 higher than the Malibu.The Malibu seems to be a quieter and smoother ride. The headrests are gigantic and are problematic backing up. I suppose I really need to learn how to use side view mirrors properly. I prefer the looks of the Malibu exterior.The Fusion isn't as quiet or smooth, but the seat goes up higher and the head rests don't seem to be AS intrusive as the Malibu's. I'm no techie but the Sync seems pretty slick, if I could figure it out. Don't even own an I-pod at this point.Any suggestions for deciding which one to buy? ",Posts: 8,Member

Maybe the choice will be easier asking some questions, such as:Which car do you visualize still enjoying in about four years?Which one has a more comfortable ride?Which car has higher ratings overall?Is this a good time to learn use side mirrors for your safety and safety of your passengers?Which car has better colors or interiors?Which car is more likely to have fewer changes in the next few years to make the 2011 look more dated?Hope this helps.

The Fusion will have a higher resale value than the Malibu, especially in the first few years. According to Edmunds 'True Cost to Own' calculation, the Fusion SEL depreciates $2354 in the first year and the Malibu LTZ is more than double at $4712 in the first year alone. Without a 15-20% down payment and/or a very low interest rate, you would have negative equity in the Malibu for the first few years! In other words, you'd owe more than the car is worth.The Fusion may not be as smooth/cushy, but it does have some advantages over the Malibu. According to Consumer Reports test results, the Fusion has better overall handling and better emergency handling, shorter braking distances (stops faster) especially on wet roads, and has better passing power because the transmission will kick down more readily when you press the gas. All of those are safety benefits in my book, plus the SYNC and non-obtrusive headrests are safer as well!As far as the Fusion's exterior looks, the regular SEL is a little plain looking, some colors more so than others. Did you look at any Fusions with the optional Appearance Package? It costs $895 and has larger, nicer looking wheels/tires, rear spoiler, unique trim on the center stack and instrument panel and your choice of body-color grille or a dark chrome grille. The dark chrome does wonders for the front end compared to the standard chrome grille, which is a bit too flashy (in my opinion). It's only available on four colors- Tuxedo Black, Sport Blue, Candy Red, and Sterling Grey and only with Charcoal Black interior. There's also a $1295 Luxury Package for the SEL that has polished aluminum wheels (same size as regular SEL but prettier), chrome mirror caps and door handles, premium leather interior in Ginger or Black, Contrasting stitching on the seats and leather steering wheel and illuminated front door sills. It's available with every exterior color except Sport Blue and the Ginger interior is really gorgeous and looks/feels like it should be in a $40k car. It's a new option for 2011, probably because the Mercury Milan is history and it always had a fancier interior option than Fusion.One other thing to keep in mind, the SEL has a Reverse Sensing System option for $295 on any SEL model. It beeps when it sensing anything behind you and the beeps get faster as you get closer to the object...pretty handy, in my experience.The Fusion also has a larger trunk than the Malibu (15.1 cu ft vs. 16.5 cu ft and the opening is bigger on the Fusion). Fuel economy is almost identical, but the Fusion also has a bigger gas tank (17.5gal vs. 16.0) so you won't be stopping quite as often to fill up. The Malibu does have a better powertrain warranty than Fusion- 100,000 miles vs. 60,000 miles. But it's five years either way, so if you don't plan to drive close to 20,000 miles per year, the extra coverage on the Malibu is irrelevant. The Malibu also has a standard 8-speaker Bose stereo that sounds a lot better than the standard 6-speaker stereo in the Fusion. But for $895 on the SEL, you can get the ""Moon and Tune package"" which gives you a Power Moonroof and a 12-speaker, 390-watt Sony Surround Sound audio system that sounds better than any Lexus or BMW stereo I've ever heard! =) Final note- my best friend has a 2010 SEL and SYNC is awesome and very easy to use! Trust me, he has trouble using the microwave but he figured out how to use it! =) ",Posts: 801,Member

I'd be interested to hear what you didn't like about the ride in the Regal? How would you describe it?

Your desire to buy 'domestic' is admirable, just as long as you get a vehicle that you like and will enjoy over the long haul. Fortunately, Ford and GM both offer some very competitive cars, which hasn't always been the case...If you weren't aware, the Ford Fusion is actually built in Hermosillo, Mexico and the Buick Regal is built in Ontario, Canada. The Malibu is made in Lansing, Michigan and, if I'm not mistaken, some are manufactured in Kansas City, Kansas. All of the major Asian brands (Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, Hyundai and even Subaru and Mitsubishi) are built here in the U.S. also.A few other ideas- when you test drove the Buick Regal, did you take a look at the Lacrosse also? The entry-level CX model has the same engine and transmission as the Malibu LTZ (2.4L and 6-speed A/T) and the ride quality should be more comfy that the Regal. They also look amazing, at least I think so...And what about the Mercury Milan (sibling to the Ford Fusion)? It has a more tasteful front-end design and the interior is more upscale also. The ride may also be more comfortable and quieter than the Fusion.One final note, just in case you didn't know- there is a $2000 Cash Allowance (rebate) on the 2011 Malibu AND $1000 in ""Marketing Support"" (Cash to Dealer) thru 11/01/2010. So there's really $3000 in cash incentives for you to include in your negotiations if you decide to go with the Malibu! =) ",Posts: 801,Member

And on the Milan, I am seeing advertised prices for the Milan in my area LOWER than for the Fusion... no doubt related to the lame-duck status of the Milan. Which is too bad; I prefer the Milan to the Fusion. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I actually like the exterior of the Milan more than the Fusion, it's more upscale and classy looking, IMO. But the questionable two-tone interior combos on some versions are a bit much. They also dropped the 18"" Luster Nickel Wheel upgrade, which was offered on the 2010 Premier.There are a good many NEW 2010 and 2011 Milans on dealer lots...I expected deeper price cuts by now, at least on the 2010 models...I wonder if Mercury will be shut down similar to the way GM did with Saturn and Pontiac? They sort of dumped the cars on dealers at a huge discount, but they had to be sold as 'used' models after that point....then again, there were a lot of those two brands...how many Mercurys can there be in all?

There aren't any new Milans around here but I drove a used 2008 Milan with 60,000 miles and liked that just fine. My last car had 60,000 miles on it when I bought it but for some reason the high mileage is a little more bothersome to me this time. I am aware that the Fusion is made in Mexico. With the Malibu we also have a pretty hefty amount in GM card rebates/bonus earnings that we can use in addition to the dealer rebates. I'm going to have a Malibu over night and see how that goes. I'm still not sure about the visibility - drove one the other day and nearly sideswiped a car while I was entering the highway. ",Posts: 8,Member

That was the big problem for me when we rented a Malibu back in '09...the limited visibility all around. Had to switch out of that rental about 100 miles from home as there were some other issues. Put us into a Accord EX and visibility was outstanding plus the mileage was pretty impressive with the car being totally full with 4 of us & a loaded trunk.If they had had a Fusion/Milan on the lot, would've wanted that just to see how Ford stood up to a major competition player.

 Your location could help a bit. Does it have leather seats?If so, it is worth roughly $11k on a trade, depending on what it currently needs (are brakes good? tires? has it had all its services done?). You could try $12,500, but that might not fly. $13,500 is much more likely and a pretty fair price for both parties. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

The best buy is a used 2009 or 2010 Malibu LTZ. They are just like the 2011 models. These run around 12-16k and the LTZ comes with everything standard including the Bose stereo so your only choice is color unless you want a sunroof. The Malibu depreciates nearly 50% in two years. The new LTZ will run about $26000 with a rebate. I've given up buying new GM cars unless I plan to keep the car 5 years or more. My 2006 Impala cost about $23,000 and two years later with 20,000 miles I sold it to a used car lot for $12,800 . It was advertised by the lot for $13,600 and sat there for nearly a month. (this was a silver LT2 with Bose stereo and flip and fold seats -nothing wrong with it -garage kept -like new). Buying a new GM car that you only plan to keep for three years or so is a big waste of money. ",Posts: 299,Member

Yet, despite being total bland blobs, I've not had a GM car in the last 20 years or so not last until it was at least 12-13 years old. That' s a good decade of reliable service for 10-12K. If you buy a 2-3 year old model. I know everyone bags on the domestics, but if money is an issue, well, a used GM still beats a tiny econobox. (as I've said, it BETTER be more car, since it cost 25-30K new) And, to be honest, Toyota and Honda price their cars and repairs like Volvo did 15-20 years ago - just a huge premium for no good reason. Let the other guy eat the depreciation. If they're rich enough to buy new cars, well, they are going to be the first bawling their eyes out when the floor falls out of this economy. Me? My car will long be paid off. And I've been there years ago with no car and taking the bus. Even bad wheels beat no wheels - and that repo man isn't going to care about your lost job or your dog's operation or whatever else you've got wrong in your life.note - I have several friends and relatives that are spending over $1K a month in car payments and insurance on both of their cars.

I think new car buyers here would appreciate slacking off on brow-beating about the new/used car thing. Everybody who buys new doesn't have a $1,000 car payment who can't afford it. Truth is, buying a 2009 car versus a new one won't save that much money, especially with brands that hold resale well. If you're financing, you'll have higher rates vs. new car rates as well, typically. To some, an extra $30 a month is worth peace-of-mind knowing who nobody beat the car to death before selling it. $30 a month is one nice dinner for 2. Crying because they're now broke when they could've bought new? That argument only works if you were torn between a used Sonata and a new 750iL. If a $2,000-$3,000 is the difference in making or breaking you, you have no business shopping cars that are only 2 years old; you should be driving a beater and saving your car payment money.

Well, it's both of their new cars adding up to $1000 total. Or about $500 each with registration and insurance factored in.But wait, a 2009 car won't save you a lot of money? OK... Let's pick a random ""hot"" car. um.. A G37. Yeah, that's just totally random and I have no idea what the depreciation is, and I'm doing this off of the top of my head as I'm typing this, so let's go find out if I'm correct or full of it...New, it's $36,932 for the Sport/Appearance model. This represents the best value for the options to make this as unfair as possible.(if you option out a Journey the same, it's $39995! - I'm nothing if not cheap. 2009 Journey model with everything on it... (no idea, really)http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=284103648$25K. Bit higher mileage, but that's certainly mostly highway miles in 1.5 years. With registration(let's say you live in a state with no sales tax, even), that's still a $12K difference in two years. In California, that's actually a $15K difference after the tax man gets to your wallet. But wait, that's an anomaly, surely. Let's pick another random car. A Honda Civic. Yeah. That's the ticket. Supposed to depreciate barely any in two years and again, I have no idea what the numbers are. I just picked whatever popular car that came to my mind that's NOT a GM or Ford.(Chrysler, well, nobody's going to buy one anyways, so 'nuff said...)Cars Direct new price is: LX with automatic - $18,282. Used 2009 LX http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=282224197$12,995. That's a $5000 savings. Oh, in case you think that's an isolated example, the number of 2009 Civic LX with automatic at $13K or less were.... 405 currently for sale in the U.S. In short, I was so sure your math was crap that I did this entirely blind, just to prove my point. Used always beats new on price these days. Welcome to the new economy with its much harsher depreciation. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

As always, YMMV. I just did a search for 2009 Civics within 500 miles of me (which includes large cities such as MSP, Chicago, and KC) for less than $13k and there's a total of 6. And they're all in Chicago... 7 hours away by car.Suppose I drive or fly to Chicago to buy one of these (and I like what I find). Suppose I want zero out of pocket (realistic, that's how I got my last car). Plus I have to pay 6.5% tax, license, and title fees. (We'll forget about my costs to get to and from Chicago, but those add up too.) Those add roughly $1300. Suppose I can get a real good loan rate, say 5%, for 60 months (60 months to keep my payments down--I want to minimize my monthly outlay). Plus consider this is a used car with an average of 15-20,000 miles used, probably an early 2009 so a bit over one year of bumper-to-bumper warranty left (given it's a Honda).Or as an alternative, I could lease something like a new 2010 Elantra or Sentra for around $180/month, zero out of pocket (actual prices from my area). Or a new 2011 Civic for no more than $199/month, zero out of pocket (today's advertised price, maybe I could negotiate a better deal). Plus I have a new car, no worries about how it's been maintained, full warranty, no significant service for at least 30,000 miles (i.e. the life of the lease for me), and $70 a month lower out of pocket costs. Sure, at the end of the lease I walk away with nothing. But if cash flow is the main concern, used is not necessarily the best way to go these days. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The problem with leases, though, is that even the most basic lease on an econobox will generally run you $7-9K for three years and you'll be left with still paying for the price of the new car registration and insurance. And then fees for any wear or tear, no matter how small(got to LOVE Honda for this nit-picking).And you don't have the car in the end. A 6 year old mid-size sedan will generally be worth about 6-8K, so it's like I said, a wash. But you do get a bigger and most of the time, better car to drive during those years - and since you own it, you can always keep it for longer. If you do keep a single vehicle like this for ten years, you'll be looking at about 2K a year including repairs, registration, extra fuel costs and so on. That's not bad for a Cadillac(this also applies to a used import if you want to go to 4-5 years old). A Lexus or Infiniti I could see myself driving for ten years. I'd want to get out of a lease on a Corolla as soon as I could, on the other hand. They are simply put, rattling, bouncy, flimsy econoboxes built to be basic transportation and not much else.

...and you'll be left with still paying for the price of the new car registration and insurance.Insurance, yes--in any case. But the examples I gave for leases were ""sign and drive"", which means $0 out of pocket, meaning registration fees are included.I found that the insurance on a brand-new 2010 Sentra was about the same as my previous car, a 2007 Rabbit. So no benefit there, new vs. used.Keeping a car ten years... that's a whole 'nuther discussion. Few people do that these days. Longest I've ever kept a car is 6-1/2 years, and that's a 2004 Elantra that I still own. I will likely keep that one for 10+ years, as it has to take one of my sons through college, but it only cost $13k new, fully loaded--about the price of a nice used compact today. (BTW, it's neither bouncy nor flimsy.) That was the last new car I bought. Since then, it's been used, or leases. I've gone the lease route when I needed a good car for little or nothing up front and low payments. Sometimes the cash flow is important. That was my point. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The key is buying a car that holds its resale value. A new Lexus would hold its resale value for years. Virtually none of the GM midsize or compacts do. I would only buy a used car if it was 35-50% cheaper than the new model. There are some conditions,The used car (like a Malibu) would have to have less than 36,000 miles so that part of the original bumper to bumper warranty still existed. It would have to be GM Certified.I would buy at least a 3 year GM Protection Plan so the car would be covered essentially like a new one.The car would have to be pretty much identical to the current model. There was essentially no difference between the 08-10 Malibus.. ",Posts: 299,Member

Actually, the resale value the quote is percentage and not actual dollars. You are always better off getting a vehicle with high initial depreciation a few years old. If you buy one car for $12K and the other for 16K, and they depreciate to 2K and 4K in another 6-7 years, you're actually behind 2K on the ""lower depreciation"" vehicle. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I recently wrecked my Corolla 2000 - the car went into a spinoff on the slash and hit the gardrail. I had it for 10 years and for the most part have been happy with it. The only real problem i see with this model is the winter performance. The model definitely has a propensity for spinoffs ( I had similar incident before). Can someone recommend something in similar class but with better track record for the winter conditions? My priorities: 1. Reliability 2. Fuel economy ( My daily commute is ~100m) 3. Winter performanceAny opinions?Thanks. ",Posts: 4,Member

Winter performance has very very little to do with the vehicle itself. If you put those same tires from your Corolla on something deemed ""a good winter car,"" it would also become a bad winter car.Best winter car I've had yet was a rear-wheel drive 18-year-old car with no traction or stability control. But I did put a good set of snow tires on it. That makes ALL the difference.SOO... get yourself any economy car you like with traction and stability control and make sure you have tires that are good in the snow and ice, and you are good to go.

If you own your own home, you might consider a CNG powered vehicle. With a 200-250 mile range, but the ability to add a filling device to your garage, it's a very attractive solution since fuel will run you roughly $1.50 a ""gallon""(equivalent). The price difference between a normal Civic and a CNG one will be paid back with a commute like that in a few years. And if you are in a situation where they have carpool lanes, most states give CNG vehicles lifetime access to use them.(unlike hybrids where they largely stopped issuing them).Figure 250 days a year X 100 miles. That's 25K a year. Figure 30K with weekend and other driving. Wth a 40mpg sub-compact, you'd be looking at 750 gallons x $3.50-$4.00 vs. 30mpg with the CNG Civic, or 1.25-$1.50 x 1000. Roughly $1500 a year savings in fuel.Winter performance, well, you have to use snow tires. Nothing will run well in snow without them except for maybe a 4x4. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I don't find a two point loss in one month to be excessive. Your pressure is determined by weather more than anything. With a temperature drop from the time you put 30psi to the time you have the car serviced, 28psi could easily be. Even without the temperature drop, two pounds is nothing.

Your comments about the substantial differences between the Michelin's on your 2007 Camry and the Goodyears on your 2010 Malibu were very interesting. Enough so that I decided to do a little research and here's what I found-The 2010 Malibu LTZ uses a P225/50TR18 Goodyear Eagle LS-2 (Grand Touring All-Season) tire. The only thing vaguely interesting about these tires are the price- only $98 each for replacements! For an 18"" tire with a 50-series sidewall, that is DIRT CHEAP...rarely a good sign when it comes to tire quality.The 2007 Camry uses a P215/60VR16 Michelin Energy MXV4 S8 (Grand Touring All-Season) tire. This tire wears the ""Michelin Green X"" Low-Rolling-Resistance certification (and costs $172 each for replacements). It was the standard tire on most 2006-2010 Hyundai Sonata, all 2005-2007 Honda Accord Hybrid, 2007-2011 Toyota Camry and 2007-2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid models! It is engineered to be the most efficient tire in its class and apparently it does just that.When the time comes to replace the OEM Goodyears on your Malibu, here are three very good replacements you should take a look at-Michelin Primacy MXM4 - P225/50VR18Grand Touring All-Season'Green X' LRR-rating $209 each - 6-year/55,000-mile treadwear warrantyMichelin HydroEde - P225/50TR18Passenger All-Season'Green X' LRR-rating$158 each - 6-year/90,000-mile treadwear warrantyContinental ProContact with EcoPlus Technology- P225/50TR18Standard Touring All-SeasonEcoPlus+ LRR-rating$118 each - 6-year/80,000-mile treadwear warranty ",Posts: 801,Member

Do you check the air pressure after the Chev dealer sets them at 30psi?Perhaps their gauge doesn't read the same as yours. Again as many others have mentioned 2psi in a month is nothing to worry about.You could replace the four tires with top of the line Michelins and still have a slight lose in a month. The rims could be the problem, not the Goodyears. Then what do you do? Demand GM replace the rims for a 2psi lose. They will never do that and no other manufacturer would either. If you were losing five psi per month then you would have a case.Comparing the tires on the Camry to the Malibu. The tire gauge that the Toyota dealer uses simply may be reading the same as yours and the Chev dealer's gauge slightly different. Manufacturers use all types of tires on vehicles. However, they all must meet or exceed rigorous safety standards. Everyone has had problems with various brands--for instance the owners of late model Toyota Highlanders with 19 inch rims complain about poor traction in winter and the wet roads with the tire that Toyota installed from the factory.I am afraid that you just don't have a case for tire or rim replacement with maybe a slight 2psi loss per month. The tire isn't going to self destruct due to a slight lose of air. Me thinks you are overly concerned. ",Posts: 573,Member

Note - OEM tires are always either vastly inflated in price as part of the tire/rim package or are simply whatever they could put on and save money while doing it. Brand doesn't make much difference. Brakes and struts are similar - most OEM stuff is mediocre at best. 1 - Concerning the tire pressure, the fact is that with any tubeless tire, they will always settle into the PSI that is appropriate based upon the weight of the vehicle and geometry of the rim. Excess air will simply bleed out until the internal pressure and the tire's material come into equilibrium. Given that many vehicles are heavier than ever before, it's likely to cause more of this effect. If anything, blame the low profile tires that they put on extremely heavy front ends.2 - You should go by what the manufacturer recommends and never on what it says on the tire. Case in point - I had an old 4Runner. Front was supposed to be 26 and the rear 34. The tires always said 35PSI but would handle like junk and wear wrong unless I set them to what it said on the sticker on the door. What it says on the tire is the maximum recommended pressure and it's just fine to run them a few PSI lower if the vehicle's suspension and/or rims require it. Also, for instance, if you're on snow or other poor surfaces. Lowering your PSI on your snow tires by 5 -10 PSI temporarily can make a world of difference. Virtually no tire that I know of will pop its bead unless you're running at least 15PSI or lower.3 - He's seriously wasting the dealer's time over 2PSI? Give the poor overworked people a break and just deal with it. Unless the tires are wearing bald on the edges, it's fine. 4 - Yes, engines burn and/or leak some oil. They always have.

Dwayne For your peace of mind why don't you just check the tires after the dealer has inflated them to 30psi. Yes there could be a variance between the on board display and the hand held gauge. For instance the average mpg reported by various makes of autos often does not agree with a manual check of fuel mileage. Another suggestion is to slightly over inflate the four tires to 32 or 33psi for a few weeks. This will often seat a tire against the rim and stop a small lose of air. The suggestions that people have given you is exactly what a dealer will do to check a faulty tire or rim. ",Posts: 573,Member

I don't know how far you drive to get to the dealer but if the tires are warm, filling them with air won't be all that accurate. They should be filled when they are cold.Oil changes at 2500? Wow. I guess that I won't suggest that you do a Google search on the 3000 mile oil change myth.  ","Posts: 1,874",Member

On oil, it depends.The first oil change should be done at 100 miles if the engine is using conventional oil and is an older design. The reason is because new formulations don't have enough zinc and phosphorous in the last 2-3 years and older designs (the V8 in a Ford Mustang is a good example) were designed with high zinc oil in mind. You need to swap it out in that case. And, the initial grime from the new engine is also nice to get out. If it is a modern design, it's fine to wait to 3K and then change like normal at 3-6K after that as long as it isn't recycled oil. Conventional oil fails gradually and even when it is extremely old, will still provide some protection. Stabilizers like Lucas and similar can extend the life substantially in extreme conditions.ie - if I bought a new Grand Marquis with that ancient 4.6 V8 in it, or say, a GM car with a pushrod engine, I'd immediately dump the oil and put high zinc racing oil in it for the first couple of changes to help harden the internal parts and get the rings seated properly. With an engine like the Ecotec, modern low zinc oils will likely be just fine.For synthetic, though, it's trickier. The issue is that synthetic ""oil"" is really just viscous goo with a bunch of anti-wear additives added. IF (no, WHEN) the additives fail, it fairly quickly fails and has the lubricating properties of water(engine eats itself in short order). This is such a potential disaster that Cadillac and several other manufacturers are now telling owners that they should change at 6K no matter what the oil life monitor says. The first change should be at half the normal interval or 6 months after manufacture if it's been sitting on the lot that long before being sold in any case. Sitting for a year in the corner of the lot with 30 miles on it is asking for a problem.So there are really three factors at work. New vs old engine design, normal vs synthetic oil, and high vs low zinc. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I would encourage everyone to look at the scientific data about oil changes and then decide. There are environmental and political issues about using oil unnecessarily. I wouldn't want people to think that changing oil at 2500 - 3k is the only option if one wants to take care of one's engine.As for new engines, check your manufacturer's recommendations. As an example, Honda puts an additive (molybdenum) in their engines from the factory that helps get rid of the small metal filings in new engines. They suggest that you wait until 5000 miles for that first oil change. ","Posts: 1,874",Member

Don't bother...he likes doing this. I would at least go by what the manufacturer suggests for oil change intervals since they built it. If you can't trust them, maybe one should buy a different car. The tires loosing some air in a month is nothing to get excited about. The Malibu is not a defective car at all, it just doesn't live up to the ""personal qualifications"" that this poster wants...personally, this person had the knowledge & opportunity before he bought a 4 cylinder car to know what would better suit his needs. Coming from an Accord & Camry with their great engines, perhaps some more homework was needed.When anyone talks about anything ""legal"", it will be very tough to prove that your qualifications make this car unsafe or whatever position you claim. Your standards are higher for things like oil changes & how much air is acceptable for a tire to loose every month. The ""normal standards"" for this particular car are what the engineers chose for peak & most economical performance. Doubt highly that the manufacturer deceived you in any way.Think also we have some buyers remorse going on here also. The 4 cylinder engine was just not the right engine for you period, as I'm sure it works correctly up to it's specifications. I'd talk with the dealer & just see how the situation can be rectified to put you into a 6 cylinder model with tires you prefer with as little $ coming out of your pocket. Some personal responsibility has to be taken on your part if the car didn't live up ""to your standards"" as yours will be different than mine or other posters in these forums.So just talk with your dealer politely & ""fix"" the situation...period, so you can just move on...you've created unnecessary aggravation for yourself here!The Sandman :sick: :shades:  ","Posts: 6,101",Member

Hi bdyment: Thank you for your response to my postings. ---- Please be assured that all the responses are greatly appreciated. I drove this vehicle to the service station and inflated the tires to 32psi last week. ---- I then parked the vehicle in the driveway. ---- I have been driving my 2007 V6 Camry in the snow, because the Malibu is not as good as the Camry in the snow. ------ The weight of the V6 engine makes a BIG difference!  In terms of performance, a four cylinder Honda, Camry, Nissan, Hyundai, or Kia could run rings around this Malibu, and still get the mileage. Having owned a 2003 four cylinder Accord, there is a ""BIG DIFFERENCE"" in performance when coming out of a toll booth on the highway with the Accord vs the Malibu, and the Honda gives you the mileage. ----- The down side to the Honda is the seating. It is VERY HARD and VERY TIGHT! The Honda has a 5 speed trans, while the Malibu has a 6 speed trans. With that fact in mind, the Malibu should at least equal the Honda in mileage & performance, but such is not the case! ---- When I took the test drive, I drove the vehicle on secondary roads, (not on the highway!) ---- It seemed to have an adequate ""pick-up"" and reserve power! ---- Once I started to drive it on the highway, I started to notice that at 60 mph it really lacks quality passing power. This is where the Honda Accord excels. ---- The engine is just too small for this size vehicle. The engine is working ""very hard"" when on the highway. At 60 mph, my Camry floats along the road. If I take my foot off the accelerator, the vehicle coast along the road. The Malibu is the direct opposite. (THIS COULD BE THE RESULT OF THE POOR QUALITY TIRES ON THE MALIBU!) The Camry has Michelin tires, and the Malibu has ""bottom of the line Goodyear tires."" ---- The Malibu is a good copy of the Honda Accord, but GM did not finish the job.

The way to solve the 4 vs 6 issue is to just buy a 4 cylinder Accord. The clutch is electro-mechanical without any actual linkage, so it is literally as precise and easy as a video game.It accelerates in traffic exactly as quick as the 6 with automatic since there's no time spent waiting for it to wind up and get moving. Shifting is excellent and the car feels light on its feet. Now, if you really want something better, consider a used or CPO 2007 CTS with manual and the 2.8L engine. Quick shifting and more than enough power, decently nice interior (I know everyone panned it vs the competition, but it is nicer than a typical economy sedan) , and you won't even have to spend $15K. If getting around town is all you want to do, the 2.8 is great as you can consistently get 29-30mpg highway with cruise control on. MPG is identical to everyone else's 6 cylinder/auto combination if you drive it conservatively. (official was 17/27 - real world is about 24-25mpg for typical commuting) ","Posts: 3,738",Member

So I'm buying a car as a wedding present for my daughter, they will live in NC. I am going to spend about $6500. I'm shopping cars with asking prices from $6000-$8500. I have narrowed it down to about 4 general cars although nothing specific. A 2006 Sonata v6 with about 100k, a 2003ish 3.5 Altima with 125-150k, A 2007 Impala 3.9 with 90k, or a 2003 V8 LS with 125k. I wasn't really looking at the LS at first but some really nice examples are out there in this price range and are by far the most plush. The Impala would still have 10k miles on the factory powertrain warranty and is cheeper to insure. The Altima seems like the nicest car, but they have more miles to get in this price range and seem a bit more abused. The Sonata just seems all aound good but not great in any one area. I'm staying away from the 4 cylinder versions as they seem to have more problems as the mileage racks up and to me seem underpowered. Any thoughts or additions to my shopping list?

well, judging by trade-in values, you shouldn't need to go that high on the miles with the Altima. If you can find one, an '03 with 100k is right around the same value as the '06 Sonata you listed. And, believe it or not, an '03 LS with 100k is worth even less than either of those. An '04 with 100k is more in line with the value of the Sonata and Altima. If you are finding an '07 Impala V6 (I'm assuming LTZ with moonroof) for $6500, something is wrong because it has a minimum trade value of $7kAnother one I suggest is an '04-'05 Mazda6 loaded up with ~100k, but with the 4-cyl, which is plenty of poke and is reliable.

A slightly used Fusion Sport is actually a great deal, though, thanks to the resale value.

Since you are looking at domestics as well, you should also look at similar age Buicks. They generally have slightly better engines and a bit more nice interiors than the same platform Chevrolet. http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=293369130This has the same electronic suspension as a Cadillac and a V8 engine out of one as well. Only get the CXS - it's a completely different vehicle compared to the other trims. Different engine and suspension - it drives virtually the same as a late 90s S class, which is a HUGE improvement for GM. I'd rate it as a far better car than the 2003 LS.The LaCrosse CXS from around 2006-2007 is also worth considering as it has the same engine as the Cadillac CTS, and an upgraded suspension as well. It's a total sleeper that drives better than any Buick you've ever driven before. You can usually find this for around 7-8K. Both are very pretty cars that have a bit of extra bling that would make for a nice present as well.Of course, the best used deal out there is a similar aged Grand Marquis. It's cheap to fix, impossible to kill, and if you get it in a the dark blue or red color, it's 100% not going to look like a police car.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=293384104Yes, that's under 15K miles. On a car that can go 300K quite easily.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=290959044This is a more typical example, mileage and price-wise. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Funny you mention police cars with the Gran Marquis because that's how you get a 3.9 07 Impala for under $6500. Actually I suspect I can get one still with factory warranty remaining for $4400 from the Highway Patrol auction for our state. They may be driven hard but I bet they are driven easier then the rental cars which is where a lot of these used Impalas come from. Our state, Montana, those are really ""highway"" patrol cars and get their mileage running up and down the highway on 12 hour shifts. So $4400 leaves a few thousand for aftermarket wheels and new tires, a nice detail, and maybe a few upgrades like a spoiler, window tint, or some stereo upgrades. Our highway patrol cars are solid black which look nice, you can also get a 08 crown vic for the same price, and there are some Hemi Chargers but they go at least $7500. After shopping cars yesterday I'm leaning to the Impala although we did see a nice 02 Maxima for that price range. I'll try and find a lacross CSX as I like that idea. ",Posts: 323,Member

I actually mentioned (or thought it was obvious) how you can buy one of the 5% or so that aren't ex-taxis or ex-police cars for nearly the same money. Don't touch anything that was used in a fleet with a ten foot pole. By the time you get them, they are abused to death and the interior is a mess. The paint, if it was re-painted, looks like junk.But the sheer number of junk cars out there makes the few that were sold to individuals dirt cheap  Used Imalas also suffer from this syndrome, but the ratio is closer to 20% non-fleet, and you'll spend a lot less time locating one.Yeah, the CXS is nice as the engine is tuned for torque and so it develops essentially maximum torque at a staggeringly low 1200rpm (where the VVT makes the graph go essentially flat, though there is a small bump of ~10 more lb-ft of torque at about 1800rpm). It has leather, some nice wood trim, and a much better interior than a Camry or an Accord(for what GM charged at the time, it had better be). It was very under-appreciated by most of the automotive press. It's odd driving it, as you think it's a GM sedan but it drives like it has a small V8 diesel engine in it. Since it idles at about 900 rpm, you press the throttle down at any time or any speed and you get diesel like power immediately. There's a tiny 300-400rpm dead spot before the VVT fully engages, which is the smallest I've seen aside from a dual turbo or TDI setup. A normal CTS is tweaked for high end speed and develops its torque around 1600rpm. The suspension components are also largely shared with the first generation CTS. There's zero wobble or wandering. Driving-wise, it feels very close to how the Pontiac G8 felt. (note - if your budget was a bit larger, just get the G8 and forget everything else that's domestic)And the other Lacrosse trims? They feel like they've already driven 300K miles by comparison. I've never encountered such a vast difference between trims in my life. One is amazing and if GM had only made it, they would have killed the competition. The other trims are exactly like a W body GM sedan from a rental company. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I know a few cops and they are mature normal men. They don't abuse their work cars anymore then their personal cars. Nothing like what a 20 something male or a high schooler does. I bet the fleet does better at keeping up on maintenance compared to the average owner pushing oil changes to beyond 5000 miles. They also keep the same car through it's time in service which for the MT highway patrol is about 80,000 miles. Also nothing like what a rental car goes through, I swear even 65 year old ladies test the burnout capabilites of their rental, LOL! ",Posts: 323,Member

What about giving your new bride a $6500 check and using it toward a down payment on a newer car? Altima's between 2002-2005 had various issues ranging from engine, electrical and fuel system problems. An '06 Altima would be a better choice. After that, you've got to look out on the '07-'09 models for CVT issues.Impala is a whole 'nother story. This car is almost a 20 year old design. Fuel economy is dismal, the steering is a notchy tilt only, cooling problems, uncomfortable seats and a litany of electrical gremlins.The LS is a fun car to drive, but it too has issues. Engine cooling, big time transmission, fuel system and electrical.I like the '06 Sonata. It looks to be the most reliable of the bunch, gets decent fuel economy and comfortable seats. Not to mention, it has traction and stability control. ",Posts: 220,Member

Quite a varied bunch there. Really no similarities other than all having 4 doors. I guess maybe the Lexus and Accord are similar size. Audi is quite a bit smaller. How long will you own the car? Personally, I'd prefer the audi of the bunch, but it is because I like the 2.0T and the other 2 are too big for my taste. However, I wouldn't want to keep the audi longterm for reliability concerns.Would I suggest something else for $29k? Yup! :P ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Okay...I'll be that guy that suggests something else. You list an Accord and an A4 as options, so it seems to me that the TSX should make the list by default.

decided to look this one up ... and '08 ES350 with the ultra-luxo package and 44k miles should be running you under $25k. So quite a bit below your ceiling. So for $29k, you should be looking for either a high mileage 2010 (~30k miles) or a low mileage 2009 (~20k miles).A comparable '09 A4 with 20k miles should run you about $26k-$27k.An '09 TSX with 20k ... about $24k.'09 BMW 328i with 20k ~$25k.'09 S60 2.5T with 20k ~$22k.

Your price range is $6000. That's pretty big. I recommend first you decide how much you really want to spend. Is it $9000 or $15,000? There's a LOT of nice cars out there for $15,000.If you can afford $15k, I'd go for the newest car with lowest miles and most warranty left that you like in other respects. In this group of 4, that's the 2008 Altima. For $15k, you could get a 2010 Sonata with 4 years of factory warranty left. It would drive a lot like the Camry. But many other choices for $15k also, including newer Maximas with lower miles than the one you listed. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

A first car is always a problem. Here's what I've learned about first cars over the years.1: You want something that is inexpensive, bulletproof, and cheap enough so that if it gets destroyed or run into, it isn't a huge loss.2: You absolutely do not want to make payments at such a young age. Even if the economy was better than it is now.A: This means that you want a good, solid car for $4-6K most likely. You pay cash for it. Now, which car... You want a car that is super cheap to repair and that is not a gas guzzler. You also want something that has poor resale value, yet is not actually a terrible car. ie - maximize your profit going in. Lastly, you want something with a manual as it is a good skill to learn, is a huge amount cheaper to fix if it breaks, and it gets great MPG.If this was ten years ago, I'd have said to get a Volvo 240 with manual. Done. Unfortunately as these are approaching 20+ years old now, we need a better alternative. If it was five years ago, I'd have said a Civic Del Sol or Toyota Celica. BTW, the Celica is the least expensive used Toyota to repair since the original Tacoma/4Runners in the 80s. Maybe a Miata if you could have found one in mint condition.These are still good choices if you can find one in absolute mint condition. But something newer would be better of course.B: Get something classic. The advantage here is zero depreciation. Work on it a bit and drive it - then sell it for no real loss. The downside is you have to do some work yourself and shop carefully. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

They are all good vehicles. For price and reliability the Camry is probably your best bet. The Camry will get better fuel economy too and will not need much in the way of repairs. Do get it checked out first to make sure it doesn't have any surprises. My daughter has a '99 Camry still going strong at 165,000 miles. The Altimas sound a little pricey for their age. I also own an '01 Maxima which has been a great car, but it is not as good on fuel economy as her Toyota. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

The 2.5 liter engine in the Altima does have some issues on some years that can be catastrophic, so its best to avoid it altogether, IMHO.Of your choices, I'd also vote Maxima. Although I'd want a year without the CVT ... I couldn't tell you what years those are, though. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I'd add a couple of vehicles to your list to possibly look at as the Camry is possibly the most bland piece of Tupperware on the road (plus 10 years old is old, even for a Camry) and the Altima/Maxima isn't exactly that reliable.You have possibly 15K or so to spend.- 2004 Pontiac GTO with manual. This engine and transmission combination was offered for one year and its claim to fame is a 300hp Corvette V8 engine that gets 30mpg highway. That's not a typo. You can get the same mpg as the Camry or close to it and have a lot more fun. Note - any other year or with automatic and MPG drops to close to 20 combined vs 25 combined. 11-12K, so it's exactly what you want to spend as well. That leaves a lot left over for upkeep, though Corvette engines are known to be decently robust and cheap to fix.- 2004 Toyota Tacoma 4x4. This is bulletproof, holds its value incredibly well (off-roaders will pay 3K for a 25 year old 4x4 model even!), and most of all, can haul stuff. It's the perfect first vehicle. And it's unstoppable in bad weather. This is the last year of the previous design so all of the gremlins were worked out and it's also much much cheaper to fix and repair. 12K should get you a mint condition example.- If you were willing to spend a bit more money on a new car, the obvious choice is the 2012 Mustang with the brand new direct injection V6. It gets 31mpg highway and has 305HP. At 22K, it's an absolute steal. At the end of the model year in 5 months, expect 20K after rebates. It also uses regular 87 octane gas. Reviews are great and everyone loves theirs - it's sporty, fun, and frugal. The base model is fine as well - you don't need any options on it as it's all bling and spoilers and so on.

According to KBB, a 2005 Maxima SE with the equipment and miles you noted has a private party value of $13k (""Good"" condition) and retail value of $13.7k (Good condition) to $15.6k (Excellent condition) in my area. So the asking price of $12,500 is not out of line if the car is in good condition.The reliability of the 2005 Maxima is Average according to Consumer Reports. Also, 61,500 miles is pretty low for a six-year-old car.If you like the Maxima and can afford it, have it checked out by a mechanic and if it looks good, make an offer (maybe $12k even). Life is short. Drive something you will enjoy driving, if the budget allows it.P.S. 2005 Maximas have a regular 5-speed automatic, not the CVT, if that is a concern. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I'm assuming you didn't take into account potential insurance rates for a young driver when you made the ""obvious"" Mustang suggestion. It's a first car... bland is OK. Bland is good for insurance rates. Bland doesn't upset you when the vehicle finally dies or gets in a fender-bender. I'm a strong anti-advocate of getting an awesome first car. Wait til you've got the $$ and the experience, THEN get it. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

The insurance rates for a young driver hardly are different between any of these cars, to be honest. The V6 Mustang isn't considered to be problematic. The insurance companies ARE smart enough to factor in the fact that it's the base model. (why I recommended that specific trim level) In fact, I ran across several posts about this after a quick online search that suggested that a base model Mustang would be about the same as a new Elantra or Accord or similar. It's the V8 and GT that is 2x normal cost. They still see the V6 as a bland commuter-box in their computers.He'll be paying close to $2K a year no matter what, anyways. Maybe the Tacoma would save him $300 or so a year, if that. I'd still recommend a used 4WD Tacoma as my top choice, though. Get a standard cab 4 cylinder model with manual and 4WD. The number of times I needed to haul stuff as a young person in my early to mid 20s numbered in the hundreds. Just not having to rent a U-Haul when you move is huge. Giving your friends help because you are the only one with such a vehicle is a great way to make friends as well.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=295781686This is a perfect example - it even comes with a shell. http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=293124365Extended cab. Use it. Abuse it. And it's also going to plow through a Yaris like a tin can in a crash. Insurance rates are great, repairs are cheap as dirt, and 300-400K miles isn't uncommon before they die. And they are great in winter - just ignore any snow under about a foot. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Well, he did say $15K and sometimes you can get factory financing rates at the end of the year for $20K that are comparable to a used car loan for $15-16K. Just something to think about if he's willing to wait until the new model year is out. Considering that it comes with a warranty and this would serve as his first and second vehicle, since there's no reason to get rid of it in 2-3 years like a typical ""first car"", this might actually save him some money if he keeps it for 8-10 years. It will also break down less and be less of a headache.Your first car should be something simple as a rock and cheap to fix or new and make the most out of the warranty period. I did a search a while back for a similar car for myself - what is cheap as dirt and a fun car to drive? The Mustang made the short list as year-end base models can squeak in at just under $20K.I'd still recommend the Tacoma though. He could drive it for three years and sell it for $9K in a week to some off-roader. Something like $1K a year in depreciation, if that. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Stay away from the Maxima -- the 04-06 auto transmission will give you problems sooner or later and also the 04-08 engine's timing chain tensioners have a crappy design so both of those are costly repairs (check out forums.maxima.org and look around there) -- look for clean 02-03's they should be less problematic or an 07+I had a 95 Maxima for my first car (my dad bought it in 2003) and I traded that in for an 07 Maxima late 2009. The 07 has been running fine *knock on wood* and it has the CVT auto transmission which is ok (Nissan warranties it for 10yr/120k miles) and so far the timing chain tensioners havent given me a problem (looking to get a manual car in a year or so, will trade the car in then). The gas mileage is terrible -- 14-16mpg with winter gas, 15-17mpg with summer gas (mostly city driving with some highway)The 07+ Altima also has a CVT trans (warranty til 10yr/120k mi) but it was the first yr redesign so it might have more rattles than a newer one, but havent looked into them much to see what common problems they have (check out nissanclub.com/forums and look around there before buying)The Camry seems clean (not sure if they have any engine/trans problems) -- look around on toyotanation.comI also remember seeing 1 or 2 good sellers on eBay Motors from OH with really good feedback a couple months back so also look around on there for carsWhatever car you buy make sure you get insurance quotes first so you know how much it'll be and also make sure you leave some money on the side incase the car does need repairs/maintenance -- take someone with you who knows a lil about cars and have them drive it to make sure it feels fine (pick up/handling/braking) and also check the tires to see how much tread is left ",Posts: 92,Member

Well, ""I have 15K"" almost always means ""I can afford/have a loan limit of 15K for a used car"". (ie - not cash) Used car rates are usually 2-3% higher than new car rates (7-9%+ isn't uncommon), and Ford and GM are known to give 0% on previous year cars. The difference in payments is only a few dollars more for the new car after you factor in repairs and upkeep on a 7-10 year old car.You want your first car to be new and serve as your second or third car OR it needs to be 2-4K and dirt cheap. 12-15K is asking to eat a ton of money in repairs, depreciation, and cost to get another car in a few years. Anything that's 10 years old, he won;'t want to drive more than 3-5 years, and that means he loses a lot of money every time he trades. In simple math - 15K(inc tax) - 8K in depreciation in four more years. Cost is $19K(~$4K in interest) plus $4K in repairs and upkeep(transmission somewhere around the 10-12 yr mark). Total loan and repair cost over 4 years is $23,000 - 7K sale price. 16K to own for 4 years. About $333 a month. Not too terrible, actually.Note: loan payments run about $395 a month/48 months plus ~$100 in repairs. $22K for a new car at 0% financing. Keep for 4 years. $25K including tax plus $1K in repairs(if that). $26K over 4 years. Sell for $15K. $11K loan and repairs cost(!) That covers the extra cost of insurance and registration for the new car and then some. But obviously you don't keep the new car for just 4 years. You keep it for *8*. Then you sell it for $8K. Add another $3K in upkeep. Net cost is 29K - 8K, or $21K for 8 years. About $220 a month.Note - loan payments run about $520 a month/48 months plus nearly nothing in repairs. It looks deceiving - but the secondary costs (repairs grow faster on the used car) and the depreciation hit you hard on the used car in this case, mostly because of the interest you are eating on the used car loan vs none on the new car. I calculate that you'd still come out slightly ahead at even 2.9% on the new car. Because, remember, you'll need another ""used"" car in 4 years which repeats the process. Buying new saves you an entire car loan cycle, which is where your cost savings comes in.Also, over time, the new car will be costing you $0 a month to the bank since the initial payments will be over in 48 months on both loans. You pay more now and less later, which is better. You've ended up slightly ahead at 4 years and the rest is gravy - keep it as long as you need or want to without payments every month. This gives you more mobility with your money/cash flow as well as a better credit rating due to a paid off loan and no debt load from a car loan. EDIT - AND, at the end of the 8 years, your new car is merely as old as the used car when you just got it. If you want parity, you'd keep your new car to 12 years! Then the math gets crazy as you've skipped *two* car loans.Given all of that, you'd obviously chose the new car that's more reliable and doesn't have someone else's farts and funk in it. :P ","Posts: 3,738",Member

As few people suggested that I should keep some money aside as m buying as used vehicle. Camry sounds a better option. Fits within price range and will have some money saved for unusual scenarios too.I wish I can find a altima 2007 for that price with low miles(wishful thinking) but prices in Ohio are higher.

Well, do at least run the numbers against the used car versus a similar new car like I suggested above. If you can absorb the initially higher monthly payments for a few years, you can end up way ahead if you keep the new car for 8-12 years vs 4 or so for the used one(you won't want a 13-14 year old Camry any more, trust me).Your bank will help you here - it's their job to make your money work best for you and they'll do a better job than I can do here.Also, a lease might be even cheaper per month. When I see an Accord at $250 a month with $0 down, that's hard to wrap my brain around. A used car loan will run that much in payments and interest, and you're stuck with repairs on the old car vs none on the new. One of these ""we're dying for money"" leases that the manufacturers are offering right now might be better still. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

One thing you might consider to stay within budget is to expand your search beyond Toyotas and Nissans, which tend to have higher resale values, to some comparable cars with lower resale values. Still good reliable cars, but less money. Examples are 2001+ Elantras (comparable interior volume to the Maxima, but compact outside and much lower price) and 2006+ Sonatas, and 2006.5+ Optimas. You should be able to find some of these well below $10k, with low miles and maybe even some of the five-year bumper-to-bumper warranty left. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Thanks guys,I need more help. The car has some breaking issues and when i bought the car. I took it to MIDAS for inspection. My friend was with me and according to him, they did not do a very good job to inspect it Anyway, according to them the rear brake rotors have some problem and needs to be replaced (may be read brake pads too). The cost will be around $300. I have been looking at some stuff online to check it, and looks like its not a big deal to change rotors, I want to give it a try myself. as the Machenic will charge me too much. Is there anyway you guys can help me? I want to know what kins tools and what size of tools i will need to change Rear Rotors, How to know If i really need to change rear rotors and brake pads? and if possible please share some vedio article about ho to do it, And which brand should i use for as rotors and pads?

Well, you will need some chocks, and a heavy duty floor jack (same type of 60lb+ monster they use at the tire store ) . The entire wheel assembly has to be off the ground and then you have to PRAY that the bolts aren't rusted and seized together. Note - this equipment will likely run you $75-$100 after tax, so it's not really saving you a ton of money to DIY in this case - though if you have a mind to do *future* repairs, you'll be ready.Other than that, though, it's pretty straight-forward. Also, since you'll have the wheels and rotors off, you might consider attempting to fix the CV joints/boots if they need replacing.Lastly, just get new rotors. Resurfacing costs as much as a new one at that age (after 10 years, the originals are paper-thin or warped, trust me on this). After-market rotors are fine as well, to save some money. New brakes is one of the first things I do with almost every car I purchase as it's incredibly stupid not to have good brakes and tires considering a small ding these days can cost more than a thousand to fix. Or cost your insurance company a ton of money if it's your fault.That 20% better braking and handling might be what saves you from a lot of problems down the road. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

$300 for new rear rotors and pads? Hell, let them have at it!It is going to cost you ~$150 for the parts alone from partsgeek.com. Then, as mentioned above, you may have some tools to buy.only reason to do it yourself is if you WANT to do it yourself purely for your satisfaction. It is not going to save you much money at all.

The floor jack is excessive, even if it is safer, it too still should be blocked as it a hydraulic device. I recommend using the jack that came with the car, BUT, only if you are prepared to block it well with good solid wood blocking built up to at least 6x6 size. (if you don't have a 6x6, then use 2x6 pcs high enough) I would use pieces no shorter than one foot, and longer is better. Obviously this should be done on a cement floor surface. Make sure where you block is under the suspended wheel assembly somewhere, that is loaded under the cars springs or struts. (not under some other part of the car that would allow the wheel assembly to drop under spring extension if the jack area slips or fails. I recommend lowering the jack onto your blocking to avoid this). Do not let blocking contact light areas like anti-sway arms or suspension links etc. I am pointing out the obvious here in places just to be safe. Your rear rotor may also house the rear emergency brake application which may be brake shoes that operate inside the hub assembly of the rotor. If so, you may not find these available aftermarket. And even if you do, I would not pick the cheapest Made in China rotors as they are notably thinner and do have inferior metal content that some will warp right from brand new on the first heavy brake application. The very best rotor is also not needed. I would go middle of the road in cost, just make sure they aren't charging you middle road prices but delivering the cheap rotors. As for pads, I tend to use soft material pads that do not last as long but are easier on the rotors. I especially recommend this if your rotors house the parking brake drum, because they are very expensive rotors, and new pads are cheaper and easier to replace next time around. This also applies more to a rear axle as it does not do much braking compared to the front, and soft pad material, while easier on the rotors, some do not grip as hard as ones with more metal content. If you have never done any mechanical work like this before, I highly recommend having a friend or neighbor over that is familiar with the process on your first time. As for the park brake bits, I would make a written diagram and carefully mark every piece and the order and placement that you removed so you can reverse your steps properly. In preparation for the job, aside from some obvious things you will need, don't forget to get some never-seize type compound which your helper will be able to show you where it goes. (one place is the adjusting screw assembly that extends the shoes for the proper parking brake adjustment, and another are the pins that hold the caliper pads and caliper slide pins). Have you considered using laws in place (depending on your state) that would have that shop do this work for free now, since they should not have certified this car with poor brakes in the first place? In most states there is a time and mileage limit for a claim to be filed. Sam ",Posts: 195,Member

You can block it up and use the normal included car jack, but most of them won't have the proper stability or length to do the job very well. Wrenching on bolts is always problematic and it's kind of foolish to not have a good floor jack anyways considering the time and effort it saves over the years.A dealer-bought car (certified aside, even!), OTOH, is required by law to have properly working basic safety systems. ABS/brakes/seat belts/air bags - al have to work properly. And they know it. Don't let them pull a fast one on you considering what you paid them. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

So I bought the Impala. It's a 2007 with 83,000 miles and in great shape. It is still under Chevy's 5 year 100k power train warranty. So after cleaning it up, adding a spoiler, new wheels and tires, window tint, polished exhaust tips, a center console, and black surround headlights I'm still under $6000! Fuel economy is fine, it has cylinder deactivation but doesn't use it much above 65 mph, still getting over 21 around town and 28 on the interstate. Handling is not soggy at all, maybe that's the police 9C1 package but it's very sure footed especially now with the 18"" wheels. Best thing my daughter and her future husband love it but I don't want to hand over the keys now!

HI all,I took my car to NTB and got it inspected. They said, its not the brake rotors, its the brake pads which needs to be changed. He said my rotor are 4.60 and they are at 4.13 right now. So it can still count on them for an year or something. He gave me a cost of $335 and he came down to $285. after i told him his cost was too high. He said he gonna use Adaptive One brake pads and going to change brake fluide also. As it shoul be changed every 3 years.I think even $285 is pricy. I am thinking to buy adaptive brake pads and some good fluide Is some local machenic will do it for a labour of arround $100. Is it a good idea to do that? ",Posts: 19,Member

Even then, flushing out the brake system is a few minute job. It shouldn't cost you $300-$400 for the rear brakes.

No, it shouldn't. But ~$100 is typical. So figure $100 for that and $100 for 1 hour labor charge on the pads. So that's 2 bills plus the cost of the pads. So I don't think the guy is way off base at $285, to be honest. Could you get a set of pads for $30? Sure. And then you buy some fluid for another $15. Then find a shop with a lower rate ... say $90/hour (I don't know any who are $50-60, but maybe that's a regional thing)... and they charge you 1.5 hours labor for $135. So now you are down to $180 plus tax, but you've done a good bit of legwork to get there. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I am stuck. I cannot decide between the two. Let me give you some background. I currently drive a 2000 Accord that I purchased new that has 240k miles on it. Best car ever imho. It has been a real blessing to me considering all of the repair issues I had with my other cars. I'd drive it until the wheels fell off but I promised my niece a car and she said she'd take this one and I guess it's time to get another car anyway.I have test driven both cars. I'm used to an Accord so it has the edge there. It also has lower insurance costs, I can get .9% financing for 60 months. The Sonata is a bit fancier looking and has a few more bells and whistles (the key thing, better stereo, etc.) and offers 2.9% financing. However, it also has a fantastic warranty 100k on the power train and 60k for non wear items compared to the Accords 72k/36k warranty. And that is a very large consideration for me. For the past 11 years I've only had to pay for regular maintenance. A few weeks ago I paid $500 for various repairs (oil leaks, hose leaks) and that is the most I have paid at one time for repairing this car. I want something that is going to last and not break down.I thought this was going to be simple; I was going to buy an Accord and that was that. However I am hearing people say that the Accord has slipped in reliability and that the car I have now is a better car than the new Accords. I find it hard to believe that Honda has slipped on quality but I have heard nothing but good things about the Sonata. I want a car I can keep for many years and not have to worry about repairs. Surprisingly, I can get both cars for about 23,600 plus ttl, so the Sonata will cost a bit more (2.9% vs .9% and about 150 extra a year for insurance), but if it saves me money in the long run on repairs it will be worth it. Hate to turn my back on the Accord though, after having had such a great experience with the one I have now.What do you guys think? And response would be greatly appreciated. I'd like to purchase soon. :confuse: ",Posts: 4,Member

You have an 11 year old car with 240k miles on it and you are complaining that you had to spend $500 on various repairs??How has your Accord done overall in reliability? Did you have a lot of problems with it over its lifetime, i.e. defects vs. just parts wearing out, as they do on an old car with lots of miles on it?IMO you should not base your decision only on warranty. Both the Accord and Sonata are likely to be reliable. If warranty is a big deal for you, you can get a Honda extended warranty. You say you keep cars for a long time. So buy the car that you think you will enjoy driving more, vs. the one with a longer warranty. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

One other thing to consider is that this generation of Accord has been around since 08 so a lot of the bugs have been worked out. Although you want to play the odds, every manufacturer will have a lemon on occasion so there still won't be any guarantees on reliability.You've had a great experience with your old Honda but you were open enough to look at other cars so you're not going into this blindly. When people talk about Hyundai these days, they usually talk about how much more you get for the price. It is interesting that the Accord is going to be cheaper up front than the Sonata.I'm a fan of loyalty if a company serves you well in the past. If cost per year is better going into the deal, that could pay for any repairs that come along... and if none do, you are money ahead. As Backy said, if the warranty is a huge concern, you can use the money you save on an extended warranty that you can get online. (Personally, I don't think you need to do that.)Of course, this all assumes that you liked them equally when you did the test drives and that any additional bells and whistles on the Sonata are no big deal to you.Good luck and let us know what you decide.

Actually, though, the current generation ""Accord"" is actually a model down from the Accord that's currently sold in Japan. They re-badge the Japanese Accord as the Acura TSX here in the U.S. So, if you want the same quality as the last generation Accord, you actually need to get a TSX.I'd recommend a 1 year old CPO TSX for the same price as a new Accord EX. * An Accord EX-L is $23,700 for the 4 cylinder model, and $25,600 for the V6. (truecar)* A 2010 CPO TSX with under 20K on it is $25K/27K(4cyl/6 cyl)The difference in first year registration and insurance fees will essentially make it a wash, since we're talking about a $1300-1400 difference. Actually, if you factor in depreciation and the fact that it's a whole trim level up, it's a clear win of a couple of thousand dollars in your favor of you intend to keep it for as many years as you did your last car.Just buy the *real* Accord and enjoy  ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Not exactly.They refreshed the Accord in Japan. This is the same model that they sell in the U.S. as the TSX.The old TSX was based upon an Accord as well. The current U.S. Accord is based upon an entirely different car a model down from the current Accord in Japan. For such a small price difference, it's penny wise and pound foolish to not get the CPO TSX instead. Because it's a step up from the previous generation Accord as you'd expect (and much nicer overall, as well) ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Don't worry about pressure to consider something else. No matter what advice people ask around here, there is always someone who wants to introduce something else into the mix... no matter how clear you make it. One consistent thing most people say about mid-sized sedans these days is that you really can't go wrong with any of them. There are plenty of people who shake their heads whenever they hear someone complain about the Accord's alleged ""slip in quality."" There are others who say that the (fill in the blank) generation of Accord was the worst because they had a bad experience.Likewise, there are plenty who shake their head when they hear about the past reputation of anything made by Hyundai. And there are others who think their old model was the best car they ever owned.As I said before, ANY car can have problems. If I were in your shoes, I'd take reliability out of the mix at this point and really examine which car you'd rather drive for ten years. Perhaps that may help you know what will really make you happy, be it handling, comfort, looks, etc. The more I read and hear, the less I'm concerned about the reliability of most anything in this segment.

They are nothing more than a glorified Honda and they do not offer much more in refinement or detail than a Honda does.Brands like Lexus and Infiniti are much different than their non-luxury counterparts.

I have a friend who buys a new CTS every couple of years. His 2003 rode like a truck - very stiff. The later models rode better. He does road trips and rarely gets 25 mpg. I may consider the new XTS in a couple of years. The Accord is fine and so is a Camry. I have rented several Malibus in the last year and liked all of them. I never really had a problem passing as long as you plan where and when. It is not a Northstar but does the job. I like the Malibu because it has a smooth, soft, ride, is comfortable for a long 6 or 7 hour day on an interstate, and got more than 30 on the road. The new 2012 or 13 Malibu just shown at the NY Auto Show will probably cause me to wait until I can drive one before buying either it or a leftover 2011. Unfortunately it has that stupid touch screen for the radio. My wife's Traverse has one and I much prefer just a normal radio. I don't want Navigation anyway.

They are stating that someone cross the battery, and that this has blown the fuse in the battery cable causing the problem. Actually this is not true because the problem come and goes. The cost the dealer wants to charge me for the replacement of the cable is about $1200.00 big ones. There is an actual bulletin out by Mazda, Bulletin 01-037/08, not sure if anybody knows if this is a fix for the problem.

The engine has ""adequate power,"" ---- but it could use a little more HP. (Maybe a larger 4 cylinder engine 2.7)6.) The engine could use a Turbo as an option.7.) The vehicle could use a bigger fuel tank.8.)

I think GM's 2.4L (and Ford 2.5L, which is actually Mazda's 2.5L) are reasonably competitive, but they are hobbled by their 6-speed automatic transmissions! With anything less than a deliberately heavy foot on the gas, their only mission is to get into 6th gear and stay there! The last rental I had was a Chevy Equinox and it annoyed the crap out of me. For example, I could be stopped at a red light behind other cars. When it turned green, I could only start to ease forward at the rate of the idiot in front me. In a few seconds, he/she would realize that they're moving at a glacial pace and start accelerating like a normal person. By then, we're moving at 30mph and the Equinox was in 4th gear racing for 5th....it was caught flat-footed and the only remedy was to floor it...then start counting to pass the time, ""one, Mississippi; two, Miss..."" and finally, a downshift from 4th or 5th down 2nd, followed by varying degrees of forward thrust! That is, if you don't recoil in fear at the noise and vibration generated by the engine revving instantly to 6000rpm+...the Ford is even worse than I've described! ",Posts: 801,Member

The normal solution for this is to put a small I-6 engine in it(2.5L or so) to give it better torque and more HP.The proper solution, though, is to get it with manual. This increases the driving characteristics and acceleration in traffic to almost twice as quick, especially when merging, passing, or zipping into a gap in traffic (which the automatic simply won't do at all, at least not safely) The automatic further complicates things with extra weight and a good 10-20% parasitic losses that the manual doesn't have. It's a typical GM automatic in that it has two modes: 0-60 in 15-20 seconds in normal driving and 0-60 in the advertised time only if you flog it as hard as you can. (ie - might as well have a toggle switch set at 25% and 100% for a gas pedal for all the good trying to get it to move quickly will do you)If you want your Cruze to feel like it has a turbo or a 6 cylinder engine, get stick.

Having driven a four cylinder automatic 2003 Honda Accord, (for 3+ years), I have a basis of comparison between the Malibu's four cylinder and that of the Honda. The following are the keys points:1.) The four cylinder Honda could easily achieve 30mpg on the highway, at legal highway speeds. (My four cylinder Malibu requires me to drive at 55mph in order to break 30 mpg, yet it is advertised to get 33mpg. ----- This is not just my vehicle. ----- This complaint is all over the ""net"" with regards to this issue. ---- But GM does not seem to be concerned about this minor glitch!)2.) The four cylinder Honda had plenty of reserved power at highway speeds for passing. ------- (While the Malibu four cylinder is ""adequate,"" it could use more reserve power for passing at highway speeds!) ---- The Malibu engine is not as refined as the Honda engine.3.) The seating in the Malibu is more comfortable than that of the Honda.4.) I have the LTZ Malibu. Since it has the four cylinder engine it only has one exhaust. From a design point of view, the vehicle would look much sharper if had a dual exhaust system. ----- (They could have split the single exhaust at the rear of the vehicle to get this look.) ---- A nice touch in terms of image, would be a ""slight rumble in the exhaust,"" like a Ford Mustang. (Nothing too loud, just a little feel / sound of power!) 5.) The design of the vehicle is outstanding. This is a ""home run"" for General Motor, and this could put them back into the automotive marketplace in a ""big way!"" ---- General motors needs to redesign / improve their four cylinder engine offerings. ---- (If Honda can produce a four cylinder that offers good mileage and performance, why can't General Motors accomplish the same goal? ----- Don't we have talented automotive engineers working for American companies? -----)6.) The original equipment tires on the Malibu are of a very poor quality. -- (They do not hold air!) ----- I replaced them with Michelin tires, and I no longer have the air loss issue. (The Honda Accord comes with Michelin tires.) ----- GM did nothing to assist me with the replacement cost of these defective tires, and I am NOT happy with this issue! Best regards.

Hi all I'm new here. I've been looking for a new car for about a month. I'm not in DIRE need (current car hasn't broken down or anything) but I am trying to narrow my choices. I had been holding out for a BMW 3-series but setting that aside, I came upon 4 cars I am considering (All are used models, from ""07-'11):CruzeJettaAltimaAccordThe cruze is just something I stumbled onto. I only added it to the list because I have yet to narrow it from the list lol. I have done zero research. The interior looks nice and the 36 MPG is attractive. That is the extent of my knowledge. Thing is, it is such a new model I don't know if I can realistically find a used one.The Jetta was the car I initially was looking at when I started poking around. I have heard nothing but good things about them. I like the looks, the apparent quality etc etc. Altima seems to be the top contender right now. I love the Jetta, but as far as gas...it can't compete with the Altima....right?! The Altima gets 3 more miles per gallon and has a 5.5 gallon larger capacity than the Jetta. Altima's also seem to have a good amount of bells and whistles but I REALLY want one with a sunroof as well and it seems to be more difficult to find these, especially compared to Jetta's which almost all seem to have sunroofs!I have a close personal friend who works at a Honda dealership. I don't know how much he can/will help me, but all that aside the accord doesn't seem to be much different than the Altima. Keep in mind i have not test driven any of these (yet). The accord edges the Altima in MPG but has a smaller gas tank. It seems the Accord has alot of nice interior stuff, leather seats etc but again, the question of the sunroof pops up...how common are they on Accords and how long am I going to be pulling my hair out looking for one. It SEEMS to me that the Accord and Altima are virtually the same cars, just depends on the selected features and such of each individual car that separates them...So, can anyone shed light on this? Make comments, give info and suggestions to me in regards to these cars? How they stack up with each other? Prior experiences. I have been doing alot of reading here as I just joined but thought I might as well make this topic to get specific feedback I am looking for. Also, can anyone comment on insurance costs? Thanks ahead of time for all constructive comments! Take care ",Posts: 21,Member

Compared to a 3 series or even a used C class, these will all be a massive let-down because they are not really luxury brands, don't drive the same, and aren't RWD. IMO, instead of a 2007 3 series, you might look at a 2005 Lexus IS300. This was the last year and as such, it's all but bulletproof. With a ~3250lb weight, though, it drives like a late 90s 3 series, but with Toyota reliability. You'll never regret buying one. Assuming that you don't hold out for the 3 series, though the recent models are quite heavy. You might be better off with a used 1 series.note - an IS350 is a whopping 3650lbs, give or take. The newer 3 series are almost as heavy. They somehow lost that small sport sedan magic over the years as they got larger and larger.http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=53002483The same price as a typical entry level sedan. Given that the car was designed to last 250-300K+ miles, the mileage isn't even worth worrying about.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=297865653This is what I'd chose, myself, but that's because with manual, these really are as close as Japan ever got to equaling a BMW.

Thanks so much for the reply. I had looked at Lexus but was checking out the IS250 instead. Not much around me though. Thing is, I don't want RWD. I'm in Ohio where we get the worst of summers and the worst of winters. RWD is notoriously bad for the winter. FWD or AWD is the way to go, for me at this point. The BMW/Lexus issue is at the very top of my price range. So if I can get one, COOL. If not though, I don't want to pigeon hole myself into a massive payment with a car that has no or little warranty and something goes wrong, and suddenly it costs me $1,000 to replace a water pump, just as an example. That is why I listed the 4 other models above. I am calling to find out insurance costs for all of these models, to see if that swings the deal or not. ",Posts: 21,Member

I'm not sure whether you're looking at new or used Jettas, but I would be wary if it's not new due to numerous electrical issues that we see reported over & over. I had one, and it was a BLAST to drive, and my individual vehicle had few problems (however, many owners reported pretty serious & expensive electrical issues... I got lucky). A new one might be better, and of course it comes with a warranty.Altima - make sure you drive the exact vehicle you're planning to purchase. We've seen a number of complaints about the performance of the CVT transmission. Not sure if it's a ""problem,"" per se, or a dislike of how the technology causes the vehicle to perform even if it's performing normally. You're clearly a smart shopper. Don't see too many people who go into the process with so many practical considerations, and with the knowledge that there is no ""one true car"" - if you take your time, you'll find the right vehicle at the right price instead of getting your heart set on ONE car and sacrificing financial and maintenance considerations just to have it.

Kirstie, thanks so much for the reply. In regards to the Jetta, I had been looking at the '07-'10 models of Jetta. I have heard that the new '11 Jettas are getting some real bad reviews. More or less that VW went cheap, the quality of the Jetta was severely compromised etc etc. Can anyone comment on that? That has been the real reason I didn't even consider a new one. Pretty much every car, with the exception of the Cruze would be all used. Cruze seems to just be too new to find used for any real ""discount"". I had heard the Altima having ""performance"" issues with the CVT transmission. But I also read that many think it works fine, just doesn't have the ""punch"" that some people THINK it should have. I meant a guy who works for an auto auction company and he specializes in cars coming off lease. He said he can find me pretty much anything I want in a fairly short period of time. Because they normally sell to the dealerships though, he also said he could offer a similar car at a much cheaper price. Seemed like a real straight shooter, but I always like to keep my guard up, just in case. As far as the ""one"" car for me. I don't think there is such a thing. From what I am finding out Altimas and Accords are pretty much the same, just different companies. A 3-series is great looking, in my opinion, but so is the Lexus IS250. I figure if I am going to get into debt, I might as well get what I want, within reason though. No point in not being able to buy clothes and food, just to have a BMW hahaha ",Posts: 21,Member

Just as an update, the insurance is leading me towards the Jetta, ALtima and Accord. BMW is much MUCH higher, more so than I expected and I didn't even bother asking about the Lexus after I heard about the BMW. Jetta came in at the lowest of the 3, Accord, then Altima. They are all close though and not a major difference that would force one of these models out of the discussion. Being that I have only ever had 2 cars my entire life, I am unsure about car buying etiquette. Is it normal, acceptable, standard for someone to go to a local dealership and ask to test drive a certain model, even knowing that they have ZERO intention of buying at that moment? I was considering going to test drives these cars but I am not yet in the position, 100% to buy yet. Is it poor taste of me to go try one and then just thank them and leave? Comments welcome...

the question of the sunroof pops up...how common are they on AccordsYou shouldn't have any trouble finding an Accord with a sunroof. Honda simplifies their trimlines to the point where there aren't really any options. If it is an EX, you have a moonroof.If you are looking at used, you may discover that the Accord will be pricey because Honda's have very high resale values. Be sure to compare it to new.I'm not so sure you will find the Accord and Altima all that similar when you take a close look and drive them. Good luck in your search! Let us know how it works out.

That's the problem, though. All 3 series are RWD or RWD biased by design, so you're kind of stuck. If you have to have AWD, be aware that only full-time 4WD/AWD systems are actually useful for bad roads as they react too slowly to deal with snow and ice and rain and so on at moderate speeds. They are designed to help get you un-stuck and that's about it. If it's part-time or transfers power back and forth, it's not going to make you one bit safer in the winter.But, that said, I've lived with RWD for years, and stability control is what saves your bacon. My best friend has a 4Runner with stability control and it will keep him from sliding out on gravel and loose dirt - stuff that is as bad as snow in terms of traction. You get about 20% side-ways and it reels you back in. On a 5000+lb SUV, no less. But it's nothing compared to what snow tires will do for you. Snow tires and stability control in a RWD car will obliterate any AWD system with normal tires. Get RWD. Get stability control. Get winter tires. You'll be fine. And you'll have your 3 Series that you want. :Phttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4s10mph on ice - 47ft vs 21ft stopping difference. Why I also chose this was because they happened to use a modern 3 series. With the right tires, a 3 series is perfectly safe. After all, Germany has.. um.. yeah, winters that are easily on par with Ohio. And you don't hear about Mercedes and BMW owners crashing all the time over there. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGfvyPtYR0Y&NR=1More BMW 3 series fun in snow. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi All: I have looked at the Nissan Vehicles a number of times over the years, but pushed them to the side for two reasons. ----1st.) The CVT transmission. ----- and ----- 2nd.) The quality of the Nissan Dealers in my part of the country. ---- The Nissan dealers are one step up from a Chrysler dealer, (both are ""bottom feeders"" in the automotive retail business, with VERY poor service reputations!) ----- If I cannot get ""high quality service"" in a timely manner, I do not want to own the product! ----- While the Malibu could use a more powerful 4 cylinder engine (169hp), like the Buick Lacross (182hp), it is a very nice vehicle. ------- My LTZ four cylinder Malibu is almost one year old, and it has 13,000 miles. ------ The original equipment tires were of a VERY POOR QUALITY, and I replaced them with Michelin Tires. ---------- This eliminated the ""air leak problem,"" and improved the handling quality of the vehicle. ------- (General Motors knows about the ""quality problem"" of the original equipment tires, but chooses to do nothing about it, which is what I will remember when searching for a replacement vehicle for my 2007 XLE Camry in late 2012. ---- ""IF"" I purchase another GM vehicle, the dealer will install Michelin tires as part of the deal, or there will be no deal! ------- I will walk, and purchase another Camry! ---- (The Toyota Dealer has already contacted me and wanted me to trade for a 2011, but I am not ready at this point in time) -------- Best regards. ------- Dwayne :shades: :confuse:  ",Posts: 712,Member

I have a 2010 Sentra with the CVT and overall I like it, for two reasons:* Smooth driving: almost a ""turbine"" feel--no perception of shifting as with a conventional automatic.* Low revving: This is the only car I've ever owned that revs lower while in gear than in idle. When puttering along around 35-40 mph, it will be at about 1100 RPMs, but in idle it's around 1200 RPMs. This translates to very good fuel economy--better than the EPA estimates. I can hit 40 mpg on the highway at 65-70 steady cruise, and low 30s in town in good weather (I'm at 33.6 mpg right now on a half-tank). At 70 mph, it's at 2000 RPMs--very low for a 2.0L, 140 hp engine. And low revs translate to low noise when cruising along.The CVT has a 10-year, 120,000 mile warranty. Not sure when that was put into place, however.If you want responsive shifting, get a 2007 Accord with the 5-speed stick. Great shifter, and IMO more fun to drive than the 2008-present generation.

guys, I just got back from test driving an Accord. A good friend of mine is a Honda salesman so I went to talk to him and took one for a test drive. It was very nice, the interior was great. Seemed to have pretty friendly controls. Tomorrow or Wednesday I will go try the Altima. One ""wild card"" that came up though, was the Kia Optima. It was something I had not really looked into but before I get any sneering people who won't consider Kia as a possibility just because they aren't in the annals of car history, it seems to be pretty solid. The MPG for the automatic (34) is similar to Altimas(32) and Accords(34).Lots of features you can add. The Optima has 15-25 more HP in the engine than the Accord and Altima (Optima is 200, Altima is 175 and Accord is 190). The sunroof that I desire that seems to be a gamble to find on Altimas is ever present in Accords and Optimas. The local Kia dealership has a professional review that was done for Optimas which gives it very good reviews and suggests that it is, without doubt, rival to an Accord, or Altima. Can anyone support or dismiss this? Preferably someone with experience and not just ""I have an Accord, it is better than an Optima because it's Honda"". I would love to hear tangible, constructive opinions. Thanks! ",Posts: 21,Member

I'll add my top FWD pick to the list:Go test drive a 2007 LaCrosse CXS. This will obliterate the other cars on your short list in terms of how it drives.- Cadillac CTS engine. Turned for torque instead of HP in this case, the VVT reaches its plateau (essentially near) maximum torque at a staggeringly low 1500RPM. - Cadillac CTS suspension, or as close as makes no difference.- Buick interior. Say what you will, but Buick and Cadillac interiors *are* quite nice compared to the imports, lately.- Gobs of options standard and a really low used price.*note - avoid the non CXS - it doesn't have the same engine OR suspension*I've driven all of the FWD cars on your list and none of them are as good for the price.http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=57916794It sold new for about $35K with options added four years ago. It easily outclasses the other sedans as a result, much how a used C class beats a new Accord (it darn well should for the price difference!)240HP@6000/ 225lb-ft Torque@2000 (~90% of that @1500), 0-60 in 5.7 seconds.

I thought you were looking at used cars? A used 2011 Optima might be hard to find.Kia has come a long way. People who review cars for a living give it high marks. If based on your test drives you like it better than the Altima and Accord... why not? One wildcard is that Kias have historically had poorer resale than Honda and Nissan. But if you're going to keep this car for several years, that's not too important. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Backy, thanks for the info. I HAD been looking at used. But (at least locally) KIA is offering some very low lease rates and such. The several times I have talked to someone about leasing they have said ""if you go over the miles you will be murdered"". I trust them on that BUT I have a 2000 that has 110,000 miles on it. That is pretty much spot on the 12.5k miles/year most lease offers seem to give. Then I would have the option to buy it outright..buy something else outright or lease something new....I still feel the used market is where I am best suited, but I don't want to rule anything out, 100%. I always want to keep the door open for potential! And the Optima seems to stack up well with the other used cars I am considering. ",Posts: 21,Member

I'd personally take a used Buick over a new Kia any day.$15K will get you a good vehicle and after a few years, you'll own it outright. My father's Park Avenue still runs fine at 15 years old. I can guarantee that a Hyundai isn't as well built. Nor will it have the features, safety equipment, HP, or interior of a Buick (or similar).The best thing that you can do is to always get a 3-5 year old car and let the other person eat the initial depreciation. Often you can get an upper-end or near luxury vehicle like this for the same money out of pocket as a typical new car lease on a budget economy car. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

You cannot guarantee anything of the sort and not to confuse the person who started this discussion but most Hyundai's have all the features, safety equipment, hp or anything else you wish to bring up equal to, or in some areas, better than Buick. So, by all means consider Hyundai or Kia in your research. By the way I have a 16 year old Dodge that runs fine too @ 267,000 miles so other than showing cars are better than ever with regular maintenance that alone proves nothing. I am absolutely sure there are old Hyundai's running perfectly well around. ","Posts: 1,371",Member

Hi Wik82: The CVT Transmission is an automatic unit. (It is NOT dependable.)--- It suffers from rattling / chattering / grinding noise at low speeds, surging and complete failure at about 50 - to -60 K miles. It has a ""HIGH Pitch Squeaking Noise while driving and accelerating slightly. (You will notice this with the window down.) The Kia Vehicles and the Hyundai Vehicles are very nice, but in my part of the country, the dealers have a VERY POOR reputation in terms of service and sales. The lack basic people skills, so as such, I do not even consider these products. ---- In your part of the country this might be different! Take a look at these vehicles. The down side is that they lose value very quickly, so your need to purchase them at a deep discount! ---- If you plan to keep the vehicle for at least 6 years, you will do ""OK!"" ---- In any case, put a maximum Manufacturer's extended warranty on the vehicle, (in addition to the warranty that comes with the vehicle.) ------ DO NOT PURCHASE AN AFTER MARKET WARRANTY! -- This will protect you for the life of the vehicle.

Thanks for all the feedback. A few comments since so many replies have been made!I don't doubt that the Buick is great. But the aesthetics and the gas mileage are not what I am looking for. I mentioned the HP in the KIA vs the Altima and Accord simply because they have identical MPG. Getting something that has 250+ HP means nothing to me if the MPG takes a hit. No disrespect, no offense meant. I really am grateful for the comments from everyone but I just don't think this is what I am seeking. Thanks for the information about the Altima CVT. Sounds bad...I definitely do NOT want to replace the transmission after 60k miles! I have gathered this is, more or less, a hit or miss situation with the CVT...but reality is simply that with the CVT we just can't tell how long and how well it will perform. I looked into the Sonata, it does seem very nice. Thing is, it seems like I am going to have to pay 2k+ more for either the Optima or the Sonata just to get the sunroof, which is standard in the Accord....Also, as has been mentioned, with the Korean cars, I am going to have to go new. Which is gonna be about 6 thousand more (Say used Accord is 16k, new Optima is gonna end up being at least 22) if i buy. Which is why I had at least considered leasing. It seems like alot of people are down on leasing and while i'm not saying it is for everyone, I don't think it is a bad option, for MY particular case.Someone mentioned the awful Hyndaui/Kia customer service. Where are you from? I have heard some small dis-satisfaction about our local Kia dealer, but have also heard some good things. I have contacted the KIA dealership via e-mail but no reply yet.

There's nothing wrong at all with Hyundai. But it is a known fact that Kia is their budget line and is not as well built nor as reliable. Also, a $30K car, when it was new, should stomp all over a $20K car from another manufacturer, just because of the extra materials and refinement. Nobody questions that a TSX is a better car than a Civic. Well, DUH - you get what you pay for. And the smart person buys the 3 year old TSX instead of a Civic. At least around where I live. Same price for more bling and a bit better image with the neighbors doesn't hurt, either Worshiping MPG can be penny-wise and pound foolish. 27 vs 30 mpg is 3703 vs 3333 gallons over 100K miles. 370 gallons. Even at today's insane prices, it's about $1500 over 5-8 years for the average drive. If you drive 8-10K a year like I do, that's about $150 a year. Hardly worth worrying about. The added insurance, taxes, registration, and depreciation on a new car is a fool's errand if there ever was one, compared to buying a CPO one a few years old. But you want something that is well enough built and depreciates quickly.This is why domestics, since they depreciate more quickly, can be a better deal. It's dead-simple to get a 2007 GM or Ford car for $2K less than an import. That's your fuel difference and more (less sales tax, less insurance, etc - all adds up to a few hundred more over the years)BUT... GM and Ford make engines that are actually among the most fuel-efficient on the planet, currently. Getting 27-30mpg highway out of a nearly 4000lb car is quite amazing, in fact. The new engine Ford has in its Mustang is incredible. 300HP and 29mpg highway. Kia has.. yeah, keep looking. If you want your cake and want to eat it as well, there is one last choice that I would recommend :A 2007 Honda Accord VP/SE with manual. This was a budget model with literally nothing on it. You could buy one new for about $19K and for a basic car to get around in, it was perfect. In terms of refinement, though, it was an Accord through and through. Just without the leather and fancy extras. But with ABS and the necessities, of course.Also, the manual in it is the best one that I've driven for any car under $40K. Video game easy and precise as a rifle bolt. The Kia gearbox feels like a rubbery box of old parts by comparison. So do most Ford and GM manuals as well, to be un-biased. Even the gearbox on a CTS isn't as nice. Its main claim to fame, though, is that everything is servo-controlled, so it's not going to wear your leg out. I could teach a new driver how to drive one like a pro in an hour or two. Easiest manual that I've ever driven other than maybe a Porsche. (but for a Boxster's price, the gearbox had better be telepathic)http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - - gId=65092889This is essentially the same thing as a VP with a better stereo. Honda has a superb certified program as well.Cheap, reliable, and fantastic MPG. 23/31 with manual.(note - this is ""new"" MPG, the original on the window sticker was 24/34. 35mpg+ on long drives is easily possible. On regular gas as well.This was also the last year of the previous model, so all the bugs were worked out. ****Whew. thanks for putting up with me  ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Plekto,Great info...do you test drive cars for a living? Seriously I'm just curious, plenty of people that post here know a heck of a lot more than I do...you seem to be one of them hahahYou mentioned Kia is the ""budget line"" of Hyundai? I just thought they were both Korean competitors...In the case of the Optima VS Sonata, are you saying the Sonata would be much better because it isn't the budget line, or...???The CVT transmission thing is really scaring me about the Altima. It seems to be enough to really push me more in the direction of the Accord or Sonata/Optima. I honestly think both Korean makes are pretty slick looking. A close friend got a new Elentra about 2 weeks ago. She was very pleased with the service she got and the deal. At least locally though, the Optima is on special for a 159/month lease while the Sonata is at 199/month (both 3 years). I e-mailed the Kia dealership, simply to open the lines of communication, yesterday and have yet to hear back from them. I am concerned about the potential lack of customer service. My buddy who works at the Honda dealership won't let me go wrong if I go through them. I guess I just have to debate on if a lower monthly for a lease is better for me at this point, or if the buying used, with a higher monthly but ownership is best....pretty hard to decide.

Why do you think you need to go new with Hyundai/Kia? The previous-generation Sonata and Optima are good cars also, and used prices are very reasonable. I bought a 2007 Sonata GLS 18 months ago and it's been a great car. A lot of those 2006-2010 Sonatas came with a moonroof, even in the the low-end GLS trim.I did mention the 2007 Accord with a stick a few posts back. My son just bought a 2007 Accord SE with a stick, 90k miles on it but in excellent condition, paid a little over $9k for it. I'm sure it has lots of miles left in it--looks nearly new inside and out, drives like new also. The SE doesn't have a moonroof, but you can get the Accord EX with a stick also (or automatic, your choice). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Backy, I was under the impression, in the case of the Optima at least, maybe not the Sonata, that the new, redesigned model was far superior to the former ones. The Sonata isn't necessarily the same, but my mistake, I had thought the implication as far as the KIA was that they just recently started ""picking it up"" as far as quality and such.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Kia_Automotive_GroupHyundai is the parent company and as such is a bit like how Infiniti is to NIssan - just with budget cars. Years ago, Kia was its own company and was far ahead of Hyundai in quality. Hyundai bought them out, essentially flipped the brands around and used Kia's technology to help revitalize their vehicles. Now they are comparable to the other budget makes like Nissan and Mazda. But in all of this, Kia became the second class citizen, and if you know anything about Asian companies, the main brand is always superior (or to be more exact, the lower brand never is allowed to compete equally - there's always a few things de-tuned or missing from it)My best friend and I used to spend weekends going around and test-driving cars for fun and also hanging out at local record stores, video arcades, pawn shops, and so on - all vintage/low-tech entertainment. Usually followed by a lunch at some place with more MSG than should be allowable by law I still like to drive cars as a result, even years later. So when something new comes out, I test it thoroughly(sometimes both of us if he's in town). I wish I could get paid to review cars. Because if it sucks, I'll tell you. But editors are so scared of losing ad revenue that ""it was moderately quick"" is about as close to ""It was as slow as a snail on Prozac"" as you'll ever read. :P Back to cars... I've driven the new Elantra and it's OK - it feels like everybody else's basic box. Nothing bad, but it's a basic thing to get from point A to B. Zero feeling of fun to drive. Of course, a Buick and an Accord and most other stuff like that is also unimpressive to me. But among those basic machines, the best engines go to Honda and then GM and then Toyota. Everything else is 5th place or worse. The best transmissions are made by GM, then Ford, and a lot of GM transmissions are re-branded in imports as well (Honda makes their own automatics, though). Manuals, though, are pretty much each company. Honda and Mazda are the best of the basic makes, IME. But none of these cars, while fine to get around in, feel like a BMW. Or a CTS. Or a G37. (this list is pretty much the list for Europe/U.S./Japan when it comes to entry level luxury sport sedans, btw) Myself, I've leearned to just save my pennies and always get the better car, even used, because I like driving and when you get in a car that makes you happy every time you sit in it, it's worth it. I've never felt that way in a Toyota. But I have in a Mercedes. BTW, the best BMW 3 series ever was the E36. I'd honestly take a 99 M3 convertible over almost anything new on the market. http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - - gId=54790460Every time I check the price on one, I want it more.  For this price, I could live with the repair bills. The only thing comparable to it new would cost 50K+.P.S. If you have a friend at a Honda dealership, you might get a good deal. Honda has leases that are very good. But most leases limit your miles and they will charge you for every tiny scuff when you turn it in. Even the Honda Accord lease is $9100 in payments over three years. And you're better off just owning a CPO for $15K at that price, since it'll easily be worth the $6K difference at 9 years old. Most leases aren't any better than owning - usually the only time it makes sense is on something that is expensive to repair, like a BMW or Mercedes if they are having a crazy promotion that month.Your friend can find a 2007 CPO Accord with stick if you want for probably $15K. Get a good radio put in it for $300 and you're set. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Yes, the new Sonata and Optima are far superior to the former ones. But redesigns tend to be that way. That doesn't mean the former Sonata and Optima are bad cars. When the 2006 Sonata debuted in early 2005, Edmunds did a comparo against Accord and Camry, with all cars at a similar price point. Sonata won. Optima beat Camry in multiple comparos. The 2009-10 Optima is better than earlier years because it got standard ABS and ESC--those were hard to find on the Optima before 2009. For 2009, both cars got a 175 hp I4 and 5-speed automatic even in the base trim (was 162 hp and a 4AT before that). The Optima has a little tauter ride and handling than the Sonata. But the Sonata is a little bigger inside (that changed for the 2011 redesigns.) So you might find one more to your liking than the other.If you can find a 2009-10 Sonata or Optima at a good price, they might be worth taking a look at. Another bonus is they have a 5-year, 60k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, so you might get some new-car warranty with that used car (I did with my used Sonata). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

First of all, you won't want an 07 Accord VP or SE (as was suggested) because they don't have a sunroof. You'd want an EX.Secondly, the Sonata and Optima would be better deals used than new because of the huge hit in resale value. Hondas don't depreciate nearly as quickly. Backy is correct in that the Korean cars have come a long way in quality.Finally, you probably won't want to take anyone's word for ride, comfort, etc. because we are all different. Some like soft and cushy, others prefer stiff and sporty. Judge for yourself when you take the test drives. ","Posts: 1,874",Member

So he should pay 3-4K more (used price) for a sunroof and some leather and bling? That's just silly. The advantage of the VP is that it is Hyundai cheap used and Honda quality.The only differences between the VP and the normal lower model of the Accord (or Civic) is that it is missing two rear speakers (literally missing the speakers - everything is there to screw them into the brackets and attach the wires), has a basic radio ( aftermarket ones work better anyways and will be installed by the dealer or previous owner anyways), and is missing the rear sway bar ($150-$200 to do yourself - hardly makes a difference in how it drives).Not bad for an average of $1500-$2000 off of a normal DX or LX.

In several of his posts, he made it very clear that a sunroof was a top priority. I'm not judging anything, I'm just responding to what he said he wants. What you think is ""just silly"" doesn't matter. As a big fan of sunroofs, I guess that makes me silly too. BTW, you don't need to have leather to get a sunroof in an Accord. The EX has cloth seats. And since the EX has the sunroof, there are a few more differences between the VP and the EX than speakers, a radio, and a sway bar. ","Posts: 1,874",Member

Hi Wik82: I am the person who discussed the public relations issues with Hyundai and Kia dealers. I live in North Jersey. There are two Hyundai dealers in my area. One is associated with a Chrysler Dealer, and one is a ""stand alone dealership!"" ---- Both have a reputation for ""poor customer relations"" and ""poor service."" ---- The Kia dealer, was a former Jeep dealership, with the same owners. In 1995, I leased a loaded / top of the line Jeep Grand Cherokee from this dealer that was the ""vehicle from HELL!"" (It lived in the service department!) This vehicle had electrical and drive train problems throughout the term of the lease. At the end of the lease, the dealer offered to lease me a new jeep at his cost. I rejected his offer, and went to a foreign name plate. So, as you can see, while I think Hyundai & Kia make beautiful vehicles in the upper end of their line, the dealers in my area prevent me from considering these products. This is the fault of the parent company. They do not put high enough demands on the dealership for ""customer satisfaction"" and ""service excellence."" ----------- Best regards. --------- Dwayne :shades:  ",Posts: 712,Member

Be very leery when anyone mentions ""fact"" in here as it's really someone's ""opinion""...nothing more...nothing less! What one perceives as a must have, others will disagree. That's why I run from folks who start talking about ""facts"" without mentioning it is really their ""opinion"" first. Having a Nissan CVT in the family since January '09, it takes a bit of adjustment as it isn't like a traditional automatic, it won't give the traditional burst of speed if needed due to the infinite gear ratios. One must just adjust their driving styles to compensate. Having to mash it to get on the freeway will be odd the 1st few times but in time, it shouldn't be a consideration. Overall though, it's been a great car for our daughter and keeps me on my toes when I do have to drive it.I've bought used and one new car over the years and have been happy so far...being a more fiscally conservative buyer, I buy mid level autos to at least have some creature comforts and my new Civic, which I bought in '06, will be lasting me at least 10 years, G-d willing. I like the cars you are considering even though our preferences are for econoboxes due to our conservative values and the fact that we like $ to live our lives. A car is a necessary tool that we need to live with but it does not define who we are as people. We also have a '08 Hyundai for our other daughter and it's also a great ride and wonderfully dependabe so far.You are lucky that you have someone at your Honda store who can steer you in the right direction. Just remember though that most ""facts"" are really ""opinions"" and an automobile is just a machine with some being lemons but most being reliable drives. And different people's experiences with a ""bad dealership"" is just that...it doesn't speak for the individual products it sells. You seem to be a very intelligent individual so I know you will make the best decision possible. Any purchase is a gamble but having as much knowledge as possible will ensure a positive outcome here.Good luck and have some fun here!The Sandman  :sick: :shades: ","Posts: 6,101",Member

Just an update here guys. Spent most of the afternoon at my local Hyundai dealer. It was really a great experience. I test drove a Sonata and an Optima. The thing was, the only NON turbo Sonata they had was manual and I didn't feel comfortable doing that (It's been very long and I never mastered it as both my cars were automatics). So, I only got to try a turbo Sonata. Overall, both were very nice. The salesman I talked to was a great guy, no pressure, very informative. Just from pics, I had been leaning Optima over a Sonata. After (possibly because of the turbo, not sure) I am leaning Sonata. I preferred the Sonata's interior setup and in person, the look of the car stands out a bit more, in my humble opinion. Optima is about 400ish lower sticker price for a comparable Sonata though and with the two bonuses (which I qualify for) the Kia would be another 1k less...The 2012 Sonatas are coming out soon. I was told by the end of June at the latest, they should have some. Thing is, they weren't told (or the story I got goes) that the 2011s weren't going to be able to be ordered anymore. The last inventory order came about 3 months ago. They basically have 2 new Sonatas and 3 Elentras on the entire lot because they didn't know this and only ordered for the 45 day period which is norm, instead of the 90. The 2011 Optimas though are going to be around for a few more months he said (the Hyundai and Kia dealership are owned by the same guys, the Kia dealership had actually sent over a couple cars, the Optima I tried being one to help fill out the inventory). BUT I e-mailed the Kia dealership 2 days ago and haven't had a reply yet. Frustrating and he even said that is bad because they have people on staff specifically for e-mail communication, etc etc. Anyhow, I liked both, alot. Not enough, however, to warrant me giving up on the Accord. So, more or less, I am at the point that the Accord, Sonata and Optima are all top considerations, all seem fairly similar. I enjoy the look of the Sonata the most I think, but the Accord has the most features, but I could get the Kia for 1,400 less than the Sonata...oh car shopping!!! lolOh, also, I explained to him that I was considering a new job and he said I should drop an application off there. So out of everything, I also got a job offer hahaha ",Posts: 21,Member

Hi: On the Re-sale side of the issue, you would be better off with the Honda Accord. ----- If you are willing to keep the vehicle 6+ years,(100,000 miles), then you are ""ok"" with anyone of the three vehicles, because the value will then equal out! ---- With the Hyundai and the Kia, you need to get the best possible price when you purchase the vehicle, because they lose value quickly as compared to the Honda. ---- I have driven the Sonata and the Genesis, and they are VERY nice vehicles. As I stated earlier, I would consider purchasing a Hyundai, ""IF"" I could find a professional Hyundai Dealer in North Jersey. In my part of the country, they tend to be one notch lower than a Chrysler Dealer, and that is LOW! ----- (When you insure your new vehicle, put the type of ""collision coverage"" that replaces the vehicle should it be totaled. It costs a little more, but it is worth it for the first five years of ownership!) ------ Best of LUCK with your purchase! ---- Enjoy your new toy! ------ Best regards. --------- Dwayne :shades:  ",Posts: 712,Member

If you got the 4 cylinder model, it'll get very good highway MPG. And there are tweaks that you can do to the tires especially that will get you an extra MPG or two (lower resistance tires and going up a size) 23/26 new EPA - original window sticker was closer to 22/31, IIRC. With the AC off and proper tire choice, it'll get almost 35 highway on longer trips. Even my old Park Avenue ""beater"" (such a nice car, doesn't quite fit the beater image - heh) gets 30mpg on long trips, so 35 out of a 4 cylinder Accord is pretty standard if you use cruise control and let it spin along as it wants to.Also, the tires on the Accord are too large. You best MPG is actually with higher profile tires. The weight of the car is (assuming a 4 cylinder ~2007 model) 3100 lbs. That means that it can safely get by with modern 13 inch tires. (!) Anything over that in size is the manufacturer catering to the 0-60 crowd and ofr styling purposes only (especially in an under 200HP car) Lower profile tires are always going to give you a harsher ride as well. And cost more.The trick is to find a replacement rim that fits the Accord's bolts and offset. Stock is 205 60 R16The trick here is to find 14 or 15 inch Honda rims that will fit and up-size the tires to match. This will increase MPG and give a softer ride on the road. Slightly less cornering, but I've had cars of the same weight in the past with 14 inch tires on them that I had to work hard to get to lose traction. http://www.driveaccord.net/forums/showthread.php?t=15096The bolt pattern is 5x114.3 and a 55mm offset. Honda thankfully uses the same rims and sizes for several years. The 2007 is identical to the 2006, just not listed on that chart. This means that you can swap pretty much any 15 inch rim with that bolt pattern safely onto your car.Just something to consider when it's time for new rubber. The size you'd need for those 15 inchers would be: 225/60/15 (better match) or 205/65/15 (much better selection) Saving $20-$25 a tire and the better ride might be worth swapping rims.

If you are looking for a new smaller car, I definitely suggest you drive the Cruze. There are several versions available. The roadholding performance would vary some--roughly look at the wheel diameter for the tires: the more aggressive cars have the larger rim sizes.I was just browsing the local dealer lot yesterday and they had some with sunroofs in stock. They actually had several Cruze's and two or three were the ECO model for even higher mileage.I suggest you forget the stereotypes that linger of which are the great cars and which are the ones that are problematic and drive them yourself. But drive the model with the tires and options you think you are interested in.As someone who had done critical distinction cross-shopping for many cars through the years, I must comment that the difference of an EPA gas mileage rating that varies by 2-3 mpg is probably insignificant in the real world. Also, a car that gets 36 mpg versus one getting 39 while cruzing on the highway isn't going to cost much more. In town mileage if you are in a suburban or urban area is more meaningful. When you test drive any car, set the digital fuel economy gauge so you can use you gut feeling of how it does relative to the driving style and particular road patterns you test drove.Furthermore, if a car gets allegedly 3 more miles per gallon at highway cruising speed (50 mph) does it get 3 more miles per gallon at 70-75 than the other car? Also does a car that may get better mileage need a larger fuel tank? No, the tank size is somewhat irrelevant unless there are few gas stations in the area you are living or planning to travel. Carrying more gallons of fuel in stop and go driving lowers the mileage.Good luck in your search. ","Posts: 26,202",Member

I went for a test drive in an Altima Monday. Very very nice. I didn't notice any of the CVT transmission issues that people have been bringing up. It had nice power but I felt the handling was a bit more sensitive than the others I had tried. I tried going to Taylor Kia, my local Kia dealership, stood around for 20 minutes waiting to get help, wasn't even acknowledged and left, went down to the Nissan dealer and had great service. I would say at this point, Sonata, Altima, Accord and Optima are the top 4, roughly in that order. I plan on going to take a test drive for a Cruze tomorrow. I had kind of passed on it but with the good reviews and comments I have seen here, I think I should at least try it before writing it off. ",Posts: 21,Member

So far, you've got 4 good choices. I can't see you going wrong with any of them, as long as you are OK with the CVT. Some people love it, some hate it, and some have transmissions that are just plain broken. If you've driven the Altima and it's fine, that question is answered for you.Good for you on the Cruze - I think it would be a mistake to skip it. It may not be right for you, but you do seem to get a lot of features for the cost. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

One great thing about the Cruze is that if you can live with the LS, you can get a great deal on one, at least in my part of the country (Twin Cities). I've seen base models with sticks priced at around $14k and automatics for around $15k. Very hard to beat that in these days of limited car supplies and high gas prices. And even the base LS is very nicely trimmed inside and has all the safety equipment and other basic equipment.... EXCEPT cruise control and (I think) power mirrors. But if you can live w/o those you can buy a very nice small car for a good price. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Went for a drive in the Cruze. It was was a nice little car. I don't think it is what I am looking for though. It had nice handling. The suspension seemed VERY nice, probably the most superb thing about the car. It was a very smooth ride (and the area we drove in was a mix of well paved and god-awful pot-holed gravel areas). Once your at cruise speed (no pun intended) it runs well, isn't loud at all. The low end, both breaking and accelerating was what turned me off. I could REALLY feel the car shifting (had the automatic 1.4 turbo BTW). It was almost herky-jerky. Obviously the car isn't made for ""0-60"" times, but the lower acceleration felt sluggish due to the shifting and slowing down also was the same. I was impressed with the room that the driver and passenger was afforded but I question if anyone above 5'6 could fit in the back with comfort. The trunk was nice and it offers the rear fold down seats. Overall, if I had to list, in order the cars I have liked the most in test drives thus far I would say:1. Sonata2. Altima3. Accord4. Optima5. CruzeThis isn't a knock on the Cruze. I rather enjoyed it. But I am trying to move up to a larger car and while it makes great use of its available space, I think the others would better serve me. Just found out I can't lease due to my credit. So my hopes of having a new car are dashed. I guess that makes the Altima and Accord the most available options. The Kia service is non-existent here which means I would have better luck with a Cruze than an Optima lol. I like the 2011 Optima but the 2011 Sonata is the car that has really stole the show for me. I just have to hope to find a used one for a good price...if not I guess it's a '07-'10 Altima.... ",Posts: 21,Member

The Cruze is great. If you get one with manual, like they design it for in Europe.

I strongly disagree. Major differences in ride, handling, interior room, etc. Also the MT is available only on lowest trim level of the Sonata. I was obviously talking about them all having the same advantage in terms of handling and drive-ability in traffic. That the Sonata only comes in the base trim with manual is a major negative against it, then.It's especially drastic in the Altima. The CVT is a miserable joke in actual traffic where you essentially have to operate the throttle like a toggle switch and ram it to the floor to do a quick bit of acceleration (good luck with MPG at that point). The manual is perfect by comparison. Guess what 90%+ of the rest of the world buys? And on most of them, having instant access to your best torque range, with a little planning of course, makes the 4 cylinder models operate about as quickly as the 6 cylinder ones. In the Accord, the 4 with manual drives nearly identical to the 6 with automatic due to the gearing ratios. Sure, 0-60 times might be better for the 6, but that's a small part of the story, ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I had no idea what you meant, it was a pretty general comment.I've found the CVT in the Altima to drive just fine in normal conditions. I ram the accelerator to the floor about, oh, once a year if that. More than enough power in even my 140 hp Sentra (with CVT) to not have to ram it to the floor. I often wonder how people drive, who talk about having to push the pedal to the floor a lot. As far as what the rest of the world buys in the Altima (stick vs. CVT), I was not aware that the Altima was a big hit outside the U.S. I always thought it was tailored to the U.S. market. Folks in most other countries prefer smaller cars. And yes, manuals are more popular in other countries. They are a better match for the relatively small engines used in cars outside the U.S. I wonder how many cars overseas get 2.5L, 175 hp I4s? Not many I would expect. Certainly not V6s.

Just a general question here guys. In the case of 2 cars I had previously been considering, I saw one of each, a 3-series BMW and a Lexus IS250. The Lexus is on a dealer's lot, the 3-series is privately being sold.Both have been crashed. The Lexus carfax has 29 different records. I have not purchased the carfax, just typed the Vin # in and got the preliminary report thing. It looks like a gem. Completely restored. Great price for the vehicle, obviously because of the past history. Basically, the same with the 3-series. I texted the seller and he said the only reason he hadn't sold it was because it was a rebuilt title. I am assuming the two cases are similar, although I don't know if the Lexus is a ""rebuilt title"". I don't know exactly what qualifies as that. That being said, how can you verify and trust something like this? Can you at all?!Finding out that I am basically ONLY going to be able to go used now (no lease options due to no co-signer) I had gone back and thought about these as, for example, the 3-series has about 40k miles and is perfectly re-built (as far as I can see) for 13,900. Of course it begs the question of ""Why does the owner want to sell it if it is fine"". Is there a way to take it in somewhere and have it inspected or is that at the dealership/seller's discretion? Anyhow, I have never looked into this and never dealt with it. So can anyone comment on this? Info/experience and knowledge is appreciated! ",Posts: 21,Member

Hi all: I'm interested in a used Honda Accord EX sedan, manual transmisssion, 4 cylinder, and am wondering how significant the differences are between the 2005 and 2006 versions. I am ruling out 2003 and 2004 because--from what I can tell--they didn't have side curtain airbags, not even as an option.I know that in going from 2005 to 2006, Honda slightly changed the engine and reworked the suspension a bit, plus the nicer tail lights (gauges, too, right?) Looking at Edmunds pricing, there seems to be about an $1,800 gap between the two. I'd be inclined to go with the 2006, but it seems very hard to find this particular combination of EX, manual, 4 cyl, 4 doors. So if I came across a 2005 priced right, it might be tempting. Any strong opinions about waiting for a 2006 to become available in that combo platter or just snapping up a 2005? Most likely would hold onto the car for several years. No other really distinguishing driving needs. ",Posts: 50,Member

I can't remember all the changes that occurred in 06 but it sure looks much better than the 05. I think you've got most of them. I was thinking that the 05 didn't have the side curtain airbags but I may be wrong.You are correct that an EX I4 manual is rare. I own an 06 EX-L with Navi and finding one with a stick was hard to do back when they were new. I love the car and will keep it a long time, especially since Honda is dropping the sticks from the top trimlines.So much depends on the condition of the car and how well it was maintained. You may find a lousy 06 and a great 05. Then it is kind of a no-brainer.You may also want to consider an 07 if it isn't too much more since they are virtually identical to the 06.Good luck in your search! Let us know how it turns out.

I figured I'd ask the experts since I'm completely lacking car purchasing experience! From what I can see, it looks like the ""non luxury brands"" like Honda and Toyota are either available newer (2010 - 2011) at around $23K or older (2008-2009) for sub $20KIt seems like the luxury brands (Acura, Lexus, Infinity) only have 2008 selections. I am assuming this is because these cars come with a 3 yr warranty and because the 2008 ones are about to have their warranty expire, thats why they slot into this price range?(With the exception of the TSX, the TSX does come in 2009 varieties too)So what do you guys recommend?My girlfriend recommended getting a 2009 Camry or Accord, that way we would still get to enjoy 1 year of warranty in case anything happened after purchasing the car and in all likelihood, we could push the price tag to <$20KThoughts?Thanks again, looking forward to your replies!

It would help us if you'd tell us what you are looking for in a car--what is important to you: e.g. do you need room in back to carry adult passengers for more than cross-town trips? Is fuel economy important? Is fun-to-drive important? Do you want a powerful car, or is handling more important? etc.If I had $23k to spend for a car right now, and had to choose from your list, I'd gravitate to the TSX and G35... 2008 for the TSX because I like that generation better than 2009-on (and it would be less expensive), and the newer the better on the G35 (I'd even get a G25 if I could find one for $23k).

Perfect car:2004 Lexus IS300. Find one in mint condition and drive it until the wheels fall off. It's as close to the same era 3 series as Japan ever got. Just with Japanese reliability in the mix.If it HAS to be newer, then I recommend you also add a 2008 Cadillac CTS to the short list as one of two specific domestic exceptions. It's worlds better than anything GM has made to date and honestly, it drives better than the G37, IMO. I know the two are almost the same on paper, but the CTS seems a bit more tuned for highway driving. The other is a 2012 Mustang - the new one with the 30mpg V6 that has 300hp. It's a blast. It has 2 doors, yeas, but it's a usable enough rear seat. Cheap, good MPG, and fun to drive. You can get one new for about your ""used"" price range,If it has to be Japanese, well, it's a short short list that pretty much begins and ends with the G37 sedan (with an exception which I note below). Nothing front wheel drive will drive half as fun or well in twisties as a RWD version of the same vehicle. And Japan makes precious few RWD cars these days.Of note as an exception, though it doesn't get good MPG, is the RX8. It fits 4 adults comfortably (2+2 configuration), and easily handles rings around most everything else out of Japan these days. It's as close to a (base) Porsche Boxster as you'll get without spending 40K+. This is one car that you want to buy new, though, at the end of the year. The engine burns oil and absolutely MUST be run from day 1 with high zinc oil. Synthetic or low zinc oil will ruin the engine in a few years. The internal pressures are much greater than in a normal 4 stroke engine and the EPA lowered the zinc content in oils a couple of years ago - to low enough that most anything other than oil made for classic cars and racing is too low for a rotary engine.But other than that need to care properly for it from day 1 yourself, it's a perfect choice.http://www.truecar.com/prices-new/mazda/rx-8-pricing/2011/54B37943/I'm in Los Angeles, so it's just under $24K for one new.

The IS might be a good choice if rear seat room is not important at all. But I wouldn't go back to 2004 if I didn't have to. Low-mileage Acura-certified 2008 TSXes can be had for well under $23k. Blast to drive and good fuel economy with the I4. In my area, you can't get a G37 for under $23k. But the G35 is a nice car also--more powerful than the IS or TSX, but not as economical either.

The IS series is worlds better than the TSX. Remember, the TSX you'd be looking at is the last generation if you want to stay in your price range. It's basically a fancied-up Civic. Compare that to even the IS250 with a good 6 cylinder engine and RWD, and it's simply no contest. Even the new TSX, while it drives fine, is so boring that it makes me want to cry compared to a RX8, IS, Mercedes C class, a CTS, (and so on).So what is the third best car GM ever made?2004 was also a magic year for GM - the Holden Monaro made its way to the U.S. as the Pontiac GTO. If you get manual with it, that year only will give you: - A 350HP LS1 Corvette engine. Same 6 speed gearbox as well.- 29 mpg highway (25 combined is possible wit a light foot - and with 350hp, you don't need to stomp on the gas hard)EPA city estimate: 17 mpg. EPA highway estimate: 29 mpg (original sticker).- A 0-60 time of 5.3 seconds (!) 1/4 mile in under 14 seconds and at over 100mph. It's the real deal.- A slalom speed of 63.4mph. A G37 does it at 66.4mph for reference - it's no straight-line boat by a long shot. The *new* TSX? 54.9mph. FWD rears its ugly head since you can't really defeat physics. If you care even the least bit about handling, you want RWD. And, no, RWD isn't a disaster like the nannys want you to believe. They get serious snow in Germany and you don't hear news articles about Mercedes and BMWs flying off the roads in winter. Many owners who have a GTO obsess over theirs and treat it like an instant classic, or add some tweaks and upgrades to it, so finding a cherry example is actually quite easy. Same as say, with a Porsche - the ones that are beaters are instantly obvious and the collectors are also easy to identify. You won't even pay $15K, either, which will give you a lot of extra money for upkeep and potential upgrades. (dual exhaust is the obvious first mod).The 2005+ and all automatic models suffer 4-5mpg worse due to a 400HP engine that's tuned for raw speed versus smoothness and low-end torque. I'd get a 2004 GTO in a heartbeat. Where else will you get muscle car performance and 30mpg on the highway? Well, other than the new Mustang, that is - but the GTO has a nicer interior than the Ford. Ford somehow still can't make a good interior on most of its cars. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Wow, thanks for the helpful reply guys, keep em coming!Awesome replies!So I think I am leaning towards a 2008 Acura TSX or TLwith the sad, boring Accord or Camry has backup optionsOf the other cars mentioned, the Infinitis (G35/37) might be a little too pricy for me in this areaNot particularly interested in driving a 2008 CTS, 2012 Mustang or 2012 RX8That being said, the other 2 that have surged to the top of my list are the 2004 Pontiac GTO and the 2004 Lexus IS300! Definitely nice to hear all those exciting things about them and they are available at very affordable prices in my area! I'm leaning toward the GTO because I have not been able to find any IS300's with reasonable mileages on them, I've actually found a couple of GTO's with lower mileage than the TSX's or TL's I was considering! Inclined to bump the GTO/IS300 pairing above Accord/Camry at this point, I'm not sure if I can bring myself to bump them above the 2008 TSX/TL as I just have reservations about buying something so old.

Well, that's after the EPA decided to apply its one size fits all formula to older ratings. The original sticker said 17/29. We all know that with cruise control on, you can get slightly over the EPA highway ratings. From what people are reporting, it gets 1mpg or so less overall MPG as a typical large sedan like a Camry V6 or Buick. The reason is that the 6th gear is a really high overdrive. 65mph is close to 1700-1800rpm. If you are patient and slowly let rev up and down in 6th, you'll get very good MPG. Well, relatively speaking, that is. The IS300 gets about the same MPG combined. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

There really is no difference on dry roads up to 7/10ths the limit. Under low traction conditions, FWD will pull the car along, sometimes spinning the tire(s) because the weight is shifting away from the wheels with power, while RWD pushes and occassionally tries to force the rear of the car to pass the front of it.Under racing conditions, a FWD setup forces the front tires to perform both turning duties and powering duties, thereby limiting traction in either capacity. With RWD, the fronts and rears are doing their own thing and you can usually use the throttle to aid in steering the car, but it also means you can't get on the gas as soon as you can FWD.So they both have their pluses and minuses, as you can see. Most enthusiasts prefer RWD for the added fun factor.Of course, each car is different and each person has their own anecdotal experiences, but I think what I've stated is a fair assessment for the general question.

Hey. I'm looking at a Nissan Altima under $16,000 after negotiation. From research this looks like 2010s are possible as well as 09 Hybrids. I'm looking at holding onto this car for about 8 years.

Are the features in the SL class really worth it? Opinions and other thoughts? I don't know that much since this is my first car. I'm also looking at a Toyota Camry and trying to weigh the options. I like the Altima the best, but I don't know if reliability wise and such if it would be the way to go. Thanks for your help! ",Posts: 2,Member

If you are looking for a long term car stay away from hybrids. Nissan cancelled the MY12 Altima hybrid - what does that tell you? Get a regular Altima - about 3 years old with low miles - that should last you another 8 years without any major work needing to be done. ",Posts: 746,Member

Hello everyone, I am needing to buy a used car, and I am looking for some different opinions on the mileage difference and price. Obviously I can not tell too much from looking online, but is the difference in price worth the difference in mileage here?I am thinking on trekking out to Asheville to pick up a used car ( Ford Focus), but I am unsure if the extra money is worth it for the newer model.http://www.siskford.com/102/2011-Ford-Focus.htmlhttp://www.siskford.com/67/2010-Ford-Focus.htmlI am no expert in this area so any advice would be appreciated.

I didn't look at the details, but if they are equipped the same, then a year newer and 18k miles less for $2k is the better deal.However, who knows where you'd be after negotiations. The typical spread I see going from one year to the next is 15k miles and $2500 difference. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Hi Techstudent: Stay away from Hybrid vehicles! ---- I own two non-hybrid vehicles, (a 2007 Toyota Camry XLE V6 and a 2010 Chevrolet Malibu 4 cylinder LTZ.) -------- When I purchased the Camry new, I looked at the Toyota Hybrid. ----- Before I made the purchase, --- I did some research about Hybrid vehicles, and found that there was some concerns about ""HIGH EMF in the passenger compartment,"" (similar to living under power lines on land.) ----- While the manufacturers do not admit that there is a problem, some owners claim that they get sick when driving in their vehicles. ----- I am NOT a fan of Nissan vehicles because they have a CVT transmission. I prefer a 5 or 6 speed transmission. -------- Whatever vehicle you purchase, be sure to put a ""factory top of the line extended warranty"" on the vehicle. ------ If you purchase a Nissan purchase it from a Nissan dealer. ---- If you purchase a Toyota purchase it from a Toyota dealer. ---- If you purchase a Honda purchase it from a Honda dealer. --- This will allow you to purchase a manufacturer's extended warranty and get factory service if problems arise. ----- (DO NOT PURCHASE AFTER MARKET WARRANTIES!) ----- The quality of the dealer is a major concern. When I shop for a vehicle, I look at the dealer first, then I look at the vehicle. I ask the sales person to show me the service department BEFORE I talk about a vehicle!

I'd recommend a 2008 Pontiac G8. It's a far better car than the Impala or Malibu, but doesn't carry the price premium of the CTS. Same suspension and engine as a CTS, though, and virtually the same performance (though is a bit larger and heavier).If you can wait until the new year/models in September, you can get one for about 15-16K.

For a college student's first car, you want cheap, reliable, can carry a lot of stuff, and gets good gas mileage.The optimal ""car"" is actually a small pickup truck or similar. Well, at least in theory. That is to say, you want something that is dead simple to fix, cheap to operate, and costs maybe 8K, at most. Expect it to get dinged, bashed, and in several accidents as well. Bonus points if it's tough enough to survive all of this and still keep running.The last thing that you want to do is to get a 15K sedan. A small SUV is probably your best bet. I'd recommend something like a RAV-4 or similar. Small, and works. Most of these SUVs also have part-time 4wd, which is a bonus in bad weather. They can haul stuff and most of them are powered by 4 cylinder Japanese engines which are bulletproof.If you can get one with manual, do it. Why? It's a good skill to learn, but it also lowers the repair bills. It also requires far more concentration, so they are less likely to get into trouble or accidents. ie - you can't really shift gears and text at the same time. Or eat a burger. And it gets better gas mileage. I'd recommend a 2001-2005 Rav4 with manual and 4WD. The 2004 model has a better engine and features, though, but at $12-15K, it's still too expensive. A 2001 would be best, as it's 4K less, and that buys a lot of repairs. http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=68920699Don't worry about the mileage. The engine is good for 200-250K before needing major work. Expect to put about $1300 or so into repairs and upkeep and so on when you buy it, but it should be fine for several years. For 8K, you can save a lot of money, and it's a win-win for your child. It can handle snow and bad weather, hauls everything they need, and gets over 30mpg highway. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Both the Altima and Camry are terrible choices. The Altima has reliability issues and the CVT is a PITA to repair if it breaks. The Camry is good, but the big deal with both is that they are too expensive, can't haul anything, and are large. This means they are harder to drive and get worse MPG, especially since the student will probably spend most of their time in city driving around the campus. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

A Camry or Altima would be harder to drive than a truck or SUV?? And get worse mileage?For students going a few hundred miles away to college, they may spend more time on the highway than driving around town... unless they live way off campus and have to drive every day.

Altimas (and Camrys) are available with manual transmissions also... so no CVT issue there. And you'd be surprised how much college ""stuff"" a mid-sized sedan can hold. I have some experience with that with two sons I have helped get to/from college over the years. Didn't need an SUV to haul all their gear.A 2004 Camry I4, for example, is EPA rated 11% better on the highway than a 2004 RAV-4 2WD (both with sticks). With gas prices as they are, that can be significant for a college student. But if there were an RAV-4 available for a lot less money than a Camry of the same year, that might be a good bet.

That wouldn't be a Toyota, then. Something like a 2006 Sonata I4 would be a better bet--and roomier than a Camry or Altima. Mid-30s mpg on the highway (real world) and full-sized interior volume, yet mid-sized outside. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Thanks for all the advice! I am choosing between those two because I don't actually have that much stuff to haul. I will be making a lot of money soon with a Co-Op that I have. So I figured that I would buy a car that would last me a while so that I could use my future finances to invest in other things right out of college. Thus, I would have a solid salary when I would need to buy a new car. According to Consumer Reports the safest/most reliable are Toyotas, Hondas, and Nissans. My dad has an Accord and for some reason I can't stand the car. That's why that's not included. Thus the Altima and Camry are two cars that last. I was wondering if there is any government aid for a student buying a car? I would love to cut down my expenses on the front end because I'm making about 70k less than I would when I start my job.

Consumer Reports is actually a terrible place to go for advice on almost anything as their target audience is Midwestern retired people and middle-class worker drone families.They love cars like the Camry because they are the best Vanilla you can get. But the thing is, both the Camry and the Altima are less than perfect lately and there are better options that cost far less money. Remember, that the years you are looking at for the Camry are exactly when the whole acceleration issue was affecting them. Also, the Altima is.. Well, I've never seen one that's 5 years old that isn't squeaking or rattling from a half dozen places. It feels like a giant version of a Sentra. I'd rate the Altima overall to be nearly identical in driving and interior quality to the Hyundai Sonata. Not bad, mind you, but a far cry from a better car.If you want cheap to fix and reliable, and good value for your money, that means you need something like a Civic with a manual gearbox. I'd say the Fit, but it's too small, really. The optimal choice, then, is the Toyota Matrix. But, you don't want one as it's too expensive. The smart person saves 2K and gets the same vehicle with the Pontiac badge on it.(same assembly line, different badges and exterior trim) You can get a used Pontiac Vibe for very little money, and it'll be a better choice by far than either of those two. Because you WILL need to haul furniture you find or some friend's amp to a gig or a keg or whatever and you'll fall in love with a usable cargo area really quickly. I also like that the Vibe/Matrix also have a perfectly flat cargo floor that's a lot larger and more usable than the Fit. It also can be had with AWD if that matters.Also, the Matrix/Vibe appears to be unaffected by the Toyota issues as well, since it was a joint GM/Toyota venture and a lot of parts are U.S. sourced.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=302110505Here's a perfect example. It'll make it to 200K miles, no problem. And, yes, you want manual as it's at least 2 seconds faster than the automatic in normal driving. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Heh. My original advice was to get a small SUV or pickup with a 4 cylinder engine in it. Basically a previous generation Tacoma with 4x4 and stick is all you'll need in a truck, and we already went over small SUVs.If you've never had a vehicle with real cargo space before, you'll quickly realize how fast you get addicted to it.

Does a Grand Caravan or Town & Country have enough ""real cargo space"" for you? They did for me. So did my MPV.

I love that design. Had two of that generation, a 2001 sedan that my sister still owns, and a 2004 GT hatch that one son drives to college. A crude car mechanically by today's standards, but mid-sized interior room, lots of cargo room (with fold-flat rear seat bottom), great driver's seat with 8-way adjustment, lots of padded surfaces vs. hard plastic, perforated leather seating, smooth controls, ABS with traction control, very reliable, and that retro fastback styling that is reminiscent of the Saab 900. They used to be a good buy as a used car, but prices have skyrocketed like for other used cars. I can't believe the KBB private party value on that car is 60% of what I paid nearly 7-1/2 years ago.

You have to be kidding me.Ten thousand square miles of rocks and mountains and desert also exist in So Cal. And then there's snow in the mountains every winter. And mud - when it rains (not often, mind you), it's like a mini-party out at the local mud hole I know 4WD. I also know that any AWD system that isn't locked and fully engaged will simply not react to anything at speed and will usually make the situation worse.(subaru/mitsubishi/audi/etc do work, though) But it will help you to get unstuck in snow and maybe up to 10-15mph. Is that worth the extra money? I had the right tires on my truck and rarely had to even switch into 4WD in snow. Yes, I ran winter/mud tires year round and ignored the noise I especially liked it how people with new Mercedes would leave as much space as humanly possible between my car and theirs in the parking lot. (bull bars, sliders, not washed in 6 months... :P )But getting back to the OP's question. He didn't seem to WANT a small 4 cylinder SUV, which is basically a Corolla with 4WD and more cargo space. What's not to like? 25mpg+ as well if you get manual. So I thought what about hatchbacks and wagons? And nothing in his price range came to mind except for the Matrix and the Fit, both of which are kind of so so compared to the RAV-4. If he hates Toyota, Ford makes a very nice little SUV as well. It's certainly easier to drive and safer than an econobox.(height plus extra weight plus better visibility) Just put a roll bar inside the cabin and you're good to go. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi guys. It's been a little bit and I've still yet to purchase a car. Patience is a virtue....I think lol. Anyhow, I was looking on cars.com in my area and saw an '09 Mazda6. This wasn't a car I had originally looked at, it just kind of popped up. I had narrowed myself down but it seems that there HAS to be more than 3 possible cars for what I am looking for. So, could this be one of them?It has a sunroof, almost 36k miles and is black (my criteria originally was sunroof, black and under 40k!). I did a bit of reading and some people were talking about engine issues (knocking and a couple that actually died!) that developed at a wide range of mileage (3k all the way to 55k). These were all '06 and '08s though. The model I am looking at is an '09. I know the '09 body is different. Is the engine though? Was this issue with the engines fixed for the '09 and newer? Or has Mazda continued to struggle with this? I noticed it doesn't get as good of mileage as a Sonata or Altima, which were the 2 big contenders, but seems to be nice and I guess if I am finding it at the right price/features it could be a viable option. Does anyone have an opinion on these? I would love to hear some feedback. With the Sonata being so popular, I think just on sheer price, I will be forced to go Altima (just so many more used Altimas over the past few years from '07 and up). But I don't want to sell myself short. So, please, let me know! ",Posts: 21,Member

I have two other options to consider.Some new cars can be the same price as your budget due to the fact that banks loan money on new car loans for significantly better rates than for used ones. I'm assuming that you don't have cash for the whole thing , with student loans and all, so you might consider a new vehicle.note - this assumes you want a car and not a wagon or suv...Two come to mind if you're willing to wait until the year end rebates come around.1: The Chevy Cruze. It's a good vehicle and with typical year-end incentives, you should be able to get one around 16-17K. Possibly 0% or similar financing as well. The advantage is that the eco model gets really high MPG and it's not a tin can to drive around.2: The new Mustang with the V6. 30mpg and 300hp. Total rocket with manual. Should be available after rebates for close to 18K. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Plekto, thanks for the reply.My biggest issue is, i'm starting a new job that pays well, but my credit is in the dumps. I had to declare bankruptcy due to being laid off and while I am back on my feet and am looking at good earning potential with this new gig, the damage has been done. So while banks lend lower for new cars, I don't think I will qualify for any of the low interest rates and such. I didn't mention this a couple months ago, because it was a non-issue but my uncle works for Chrysler. They didn't have anything that really turned my head. But the Chrysler 200s seem very nice. A friend just got one and she likes it. I went on their website last night and was playing with the ""build your own"" stuff. It listed my monthly with the features and such I wanted as only 287/month, which is easily in my range that I can afford. Thing is, it has 2k cash back, and 3.99 APR for 72 months listed and 15% down (ended up being close to 4 grand). I can't swing 4k down right now and can't imagine I would ever qualify for 3.99 APR. Now, if my uncle can get a chunk off (no idea how employee stuff works) it might be my best bet. But if not, I just don't see how I can manage or justify a new car.

I disagree with you on the Altima. You might not be aware but Nissan is now backing up the CVT to 120k miles. I want to also mention my sister did purchase a 08 Accord and had one problem after the other. Most of the issues such as door regulators going (2 within 4k miles), premature rear brake failure, door handle not opening when it got hot, hard seats, fuel door taking multiple times before releasing, dimming headlights when A/C compressor kicked on were common issues. Others such as carpet fading, steering wheel making noises while turning were not so common.She traded the Accord in for a 09 Altima. I will admit that the prices on parts are expensive (not as much as German vehicles). But her rear pads lasted over 40k miles (would have went another 10 but had them off) and only one blown fuse. I don't know long term what luck she will have but it has been better then the Accord. I test drove 2 Camrys and both had hard pulling to the right. I had to keep the steering wheel at a 25 degree angle to get the car to go straight. I wasn't too happy and didn't buy one. ",Posts: 33,Member

Except that the CVT is expensive to fix and shouldn't need an extended warranty to make the car sell. A student's first car should be economical, cheap, impossible to kill, and fun.While I was talking about new cars, this brings me to my #1 personal choice, which is to get a classic car. It's cool, it's unique, it doesn't depreciate... The list goes on. Now that means you still have to chose carefully. Electronics are bad. Things like sunroofs are bad. You don't want something like a Mercedes diesel or a Buick Regal, naturally. Note - most of these you can get for 6-9K in near mint condition, which buys a huge amount (lifetime's worth, actually) of repairs compared to a 15-20K new car. Paying $80 in registration per year is also a huge plus. Most don't have smog, either, which is great.Cool classic cars to add to your list:(note, I've owned most of these)Europe:- BMW 1602/2002. Very little to break. Handles great. Most work you can do yourself. Extremely fun first ""classic"" car.- 1990-1993 Volvo 240. The Swedish Brick. With manual, it's solid and fun. 1990 was the first year airbags were mandatory. ABS was available as well starting in 1990. The Volvo 940 was essentially the same thing with updated sheet metal and a more modern interior. Also available with a very good manual.Mercedes: Any W111 ""Fintail"" sedan. The first modern major productions car made with crumple zones, side impact reinforcement, safety glass, unibody construction, seat belts, and so on (it has about 20 ""firsts"" and IMO, should have made the top 10 most important cars of the century list) . It drives surprisingly like a 1980s sedan. But is way cooler than any other classic car I've owned. You can get running ones for 3K or so. The coupes and convertibles are worth 50K+, but the sedans which are identical other than sheet metal are daily-driver prices. Mine even had power windows and factory AC. 2nd choice would be the W108 (""Finless"" Mercedes) - It's essentially the same car without the cool styling but a few more modern features. They are totally 1000% off anyone's classic car list, so this forgotten classic is a great hidden gem that you can but and run for not a lot of money.Japan:- Any Miata. Fun, cheap to run, and not too expensive, used. A used Civic Del Sol would be a good cheap alternative. A more modern version would be a S2000. Most classic Japanese stuff is prone to rust and parts are hard to find. (ie - say, a 1970s Honda CVCC Wagon) Not much to recommend besides these three.U.S.:(note - gas isn't exactly cheap but parts cost makes up for a lot of it)GM: Any classic Buick. Why? Buick was their nicest line of normal cars that wasn't a boat like the Cadillacs were. You could get muscle cars with a Buick badge on them and leather seats standard. (ie - Chevy Nova --> Oldsmobile Cutlass --> Buick Skylark). A 1960s Buick Skylark convertible is probably the most fun GM car you'll ever own. And it's a total magnet for classic car fans and the best car ever to go on a date in. Ford has a few less options, IMO. My personal favorite, though, was the Mustang Mach 1. But classic Mustangs are getting a bit pricey. Avoid everything from the 80s. No, really. EVERYTHING.Chrysler: Dodge Charger or Challenger. Classic Mopar. Huge support network of spare and aftermarket parts. The ""Annihilator"" from the video game Burnout: Paradise is a direct clone of the 1973 Charger (they even sampled the engine sound) The cheapie classic, of course, is the Charger with the smallest I6 engine. With manual, it's actually fairly acceptable MPG-wise and yet has that classic car feel to it. We're talking nearly 30mpg highway (!) on some models. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi im looking for my first car and came across a 2006 ford fusion s with 53,000 miles in red. My second option is a 2004 honda accord 2 door coupe ex with 94,000 miles in dark grey. My choice would be the accord because its fully loaded, (leather, sunroof, heated seats, rims, spoiler etc.) and its my preffered color. The fusion has almost half the miles but its a basic model and in the color red which im not a big fan of but its 2 years newer and less miles. I know the honda has almost 100k miles but hey its a honda right? What do you guys think i should get? Whats going to be more reliable and the better choice? They are both priced at around 8,000.

I'm going to agree with your suggestion - that's a big mileage difference for the same general price. Here's an added thought: Check with your insurance company. If this is your first car, my guess is that you're young. It is likely that a coupe with all of the toys is going to cost you more in insurance. I know that's true for my 19 yr old daughter. She bought a 2-door Cobalt. BIG mistake. Nothing wrong with the car, but for teenagers, it turns out it's attached to an expensive insurance premium that would have been lowered by purchasing a 4-door. After only 3 years, she's sick of the 2 doors as well and is already committed to a 4-door next time. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

OK - this is from a couple who has SIX kids between us, the youngest of which is now 13. If you can afford to go with any kind of leather (or fake leather) interior, do it. I cannot tell you the number of sticky items I have tried to scrape off of cloth interior - dropped M&Ms, vomit or mild spitup, crayons, markers, etc. Think of what you would ever allow your child to do in the car, even on a trip when he is fussy. Then imagine that any one of the items you let him have, ever, drops on the seats and you have to get it out (and any smells that go along with it, too). He is in a carseat, so he is not very well going to scratch the leather(ette) or anything. Anything dropped on a less porous surface is going to mostly wipe off. It only took one bout of regurgitated and dropped gelled fruit bites to sway my opinion. No amount of Scotchguard protects against sticky , artifically-colored kid-oriented product. That's just MY opinion, and you should definitely listen to others. I endured a black leather interior in a car not parked in shade (I can always go out and start it early and cool down) in order to avoid the clean-up. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

First decide if you really need the extra features of the EX-L and if they are worth $2500 to you.If so, get the EX-L.If not, get the SE.And enjoy!P.S. I assume you have already shopped around and this is the best price you can get on the 2011 SE and 2012 EX-L. Given this is a holiday weekend, you might find a dealer willing to beat the price on the EX-L at least (will be in greater supply than the 2011 SE). If you haven't checked other dealers yet, I recommend you do that. Call or email the Internet sales managers at other area dealerships, tell them you are going to buy a car TODAY and ask them what can they do for you. Also I think there's 0.9% 5-year financing on all 2012 Hondas this weekend (at least in my area there is). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Good advice about shopping for the EX-L, but I'd disagree about the premise being whether he ""needs"" the features that it offers. These are luxury items (leather seating, sunroof, etc.), so it's only a question of wanting them and being willing to pay for them, not what is ""needed."" A need is basic transportation to get to a job or buy groceries. If that was the sole criteria, both of these choices are far beyond the ""need"" category. Rather, he'd be considering a used LX with a lot of miles but good mechanical condition. ",Posts: 50,Member

Well, what you want then is what police departments use.But in all seriousness, MPG aside, a Grand Marquis is cheap to run, cheap to repair, and nearly impossible to kill short of massively abusive driving. And it actually is pretty fast merging into freeway traffic.That you can get them for nearly nothing used is a good thing as well. Just make sure you get one that isn't a police or taxi.

What sedan would you buy brand new that is in the mid $20k range. Here are some I've tried:1) HYUNDAI ELANTRA / SONATA: Love all the tech in the 2012. Wasn't impressed with bluelink in sonata. I do like being able to send to gps from google maps to my garmin gps, but looks like the sonata doesn't support this feature. The Elantra seems to be similar yet costs $6-8k less. The acceleration and the noisy rpm grind for both leaves much to be desired. I can't seem to find a comfortable sitting position in both cars. In my current Audi I like being able to see the hood of the car to get a sense of how far I am from the car ahead. With both these I need to crank up the seat height quite a bit till the top of head is mashing up against the roof of the car and I'm not that tall either. If I lower the seat i get a slightly more comfortable position. The rear view is limited as well. On the other hand, the braking of this vehicle (along with all the tech abs/ebfd/esc/etc) are great and should safer on turns when it rains and even with some snow on the ground. The other car I had driven way back was a pontiac g6 that was fun to drive back then (probably cause it had v6, I guess). Currently leaning on the elantra but I want it in white exterior, beige interior and navigation + rear view dimming, and this is a hard combination to get in the new england area (or so I'm told by the dealers here). One offered to get one for me but there goes my negotiating power plus he wants a $500 deposit which he claims he will refund even if I don't buy the car. But this means I'm paying full MSRP, forget trying to get amex zag pricing. OTOH, if I get one in stock then i could possibly save about $800, but it won't be the color i want. Also I dislike the lack of automatic climate control on the elantra. At the same time I can't justify the additional $6k for sonata to get the climate control. There is a $500 incentive through motozuma/Hyundai but I have to wait 30 days to buy (which i can).2) FORD FUSION : Love all the tech, or so I think. I haven't been able to test drive one with a navigation unit as they all seem to be reliant on a chip manufacturer in Japan that is still reeling from the tsunami. Seems odd, but this is what the dealers tell me. The non navi unit I drove was a SEL without v6. It also seemed somewhat noisy to me. I did prefer the front window view and rear view on the ford from the driver seat. Not quite as cramped as the Hyundai. I like the fact that v6 is an option but haven't test drove one yet. Availability appears to be very limited. I dislike the fact that if you add navigation you're leaning closer to $28k, or $30k if you add v6. I do like that owner satisfaction is high in Consumer reports. For such a tech car it is a shame they don't offer key less entry.3) NISSAN ALTIMA: Similar to Ford fusion, once you add the navigation/ tech, you're close to $30k but with incentives it brings it down to $28k. The financing is great on this car. 2012 for 60 mos at 0.9% plus an additional $500 for recent college grad is great. However, similar to ford fusion I can't get navigation currently because everyone seems to be out of it. I have yet to test drive the altima. I'm not particularly fond of the external appearance but do not weigh that as much. Keyless entry is a plusSo what car would you get from the above?Items on my would like to have list:(a) quiet / comfortable ride(b) navigation(c) stability control / anti lock break / ebfd / other safety tech(d) send to gps from google maps would be a plus(e) moon roof(f) tech - key less entry would be nice(g) would prefer HID lights ",Posts: 10,Member

September 2011 ",backy,"
 If I had to pick one of these, probably the Sonata SE, although I like the Fusion too. But if I were you, before plunking down $25k on a car, I'd drive others in this class, including the Optima (has advantages over the Sonata IMO), Mazda6, Accord, Passat, and (available very soon) 2012 Camry. With quiet/comfy ride a key criterion, you might really like the Passat and Camry in particular. Might be hard to get a new Camry or Passat with nav for under $25k, but could you live with aftermarket nav?The Elantra is in a completely different class. If it meets your needs, great, you'll save a few thousand, but the same could be said for cars like the Cruze and Focus. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I did goto the Toyota dealership and looked at the camry briefly, just not very interesting. The 0% financing on it is great though. The lack of technology isn't very enticing either. I have aftermarket nav on my current Audi and use it only during unplanned times. It does crash and leave me in the middle of nowhere with no where to turn. A terrible feeling. The radio reception is terrible, even with hd radio. I used to have a mazda 6, and never grew fond of it. Dad has the accord. audi and VW, trying to stay away from. Haven't looked at the optima. Will take a look. Thanks.EDIT: From consumer reports on the kia optima : Lows - Ride, road noise.I suspect it is hard to step down from an audi to a more affordable car yet still retain some of the benefits of an audi. The elantra/sonata comes very close, except for the weak engine. The SE trim on sonata is notorious for road noise. ",Posts: 10,Member

I'd like a list of 3 or 4 cars to choose from, with these as the guidelines. I'm not opposed to any other suggestions, but I've already decided on a few things, so don't be offended if I say no.Can NOT include:1. BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW - Where I live these just don't have the service/parts I need in case of a problem. I've had many friends forced to drive 500 miles to get what they need.2. Rear wheel drive - No chance at all to buy one of these3. Anything more than $20k or 50k milesWant:1. Front wheel, 4 wheel, or all wheel drive (MUST)2. Fast - Faster than a stock V6 on similar cars3. Dependable - ""well I've personally had one for 10 years and never had a problem"" doesn't count. Need reports of some kind.4. $20,000 or less - Used or new5. No more than 50,000 milesDon't care about: (bonus factors, not determining factors)1. Gas mileage - meh2. Exterior Appearance - Not going to sway my opinion at all3.

>3. Dependable - ""well I've personally had one for 10 years and never had a problem"" doesn't count. Need reports of some kind. That is going to be a difficult category. You're going to be relying on hearsay from magazines, rating services, etc., who have different values than you likely do. In some cases they have downright prejudices for certain vehicles.I think your better method for finding a car requiring less service is to find a brand that has a quality service dealership AND/or local mechanics who know those vehicles and can usually fix them well. If you look at the recall lists and problems of varied and many cars, you'll see they all have their short comings. Some highly vaunted brands have problem posts in topics here on Edmunds. I always chuckle when someone says that they bought brand XXX because of their reputation--reputation is last year. What you buy this year is where they cut costs and quality or changed supplier for certain parts.I recommend listening to the reputation of certain brands' garages and independent repair shops to find a vehicle you will be more satisfied with when something does go wrong. Really great is a garage that will tell you that something should be replaced or maintained 10 or 20K miles in the future so you can plan. That is opposed to the garages who try to add on extra maintenance items when the car is in so they can increase their profit for the week or month. ","Posts: 26,202",Member

If I was shopping within your parameters, there are three cars that would make it on my short list-2008-2009 Nissan Altima 3.5SE (Coupe or Sedan)2009-2010 Mazda6 s Touring/Grand Touring2008-2009 Subaru Legacy 3.0RAll of them are fast (0-60 in the low 6-second range or below), reliable (rated above average by Consumer Reports for reliability) and you can find them for around $20k with under 50k miles.The Altima will be the most plentiful and easy to locate. The only thing I don't like about it is the CVT (rather than a conventional automatic transmission). But that's a personal preference and they sell like hotcakes anyway. It would be hard to go wrong with one of these.My personal favorite would be the 2009-2010 Mazda6 s. It's the best looking (inside and out), best handling and most fun to drive of the bunch. It also has a sweet 272hp 3.7L V6 (courtesy of Ford) that pulls like a locomotive! =)The Subie is also a great car, but harder to find. It has standard AWD and a probably the nicest interior of the bunch. Hope this helps....good luck! ",Posts: 801,Member

You are basically looking at a full size, overbuilt car. GM or Ford, due to the price range and the desire for a higher power engine. Front wheel drive...The best car for you is to get a Buick Lucerne CXS, used. It's as reliable as a tank, it's quick enough (Northstar V8 in it), and repairs are much much less than on a typical import. The suspension is also lifted from a Corvette (CXS model only), so it handles quite well. Prices are quite reasonable and if you get a low mileage one, it'll last ten years quite easily. The transmission on the first two years is also the older more reliable (and dirt cheap to fix) 4 speed automatic. With a V8 behind it, you don't need 5 or 6 gears as there's plenty of torque.A second choice would be the Cadillac DTS, which is the softer suspension model of the same thing, basically. These can be had for well under $20K, used. These are basically a front wheel drive version of a police car, but without the stigma and ugly looks.Note #1 - this coming from the most knowledgeable transmission person I know of in all of Los Angeles: The most reliable transmissions in the world (for passenger cars) are made by GM. The lowest cost and most reliable model from GM is the plain vanilla 4 speed automatic that they used for 20+ years in multiple cars. He's also the only person I know of who correctly identified the actual design problem with the Honda Odyssey's transmission, because he repairs them all the time. Yes, he's the guy everyone in the San Gabriel Valley (So Cal region) sends their transmissions to get rebuilt instead of replaced. Note #2 - If you asked for a list of the most reliable engines in the world made in the last 20 years, from any actual automotive engineer, the Northstar V8 would be in the top five. The GM 3800 series would also be in the top ten of all time.The key to reliability long-term is to choose a good engine, and reliable transmission, and to buy something that is overbuilt so that you barely stress it while driving it.My dad's similar V6 powered Park Avenue Ultra is going on 16 years now. He did have to have the original transmission replaced at 15 years old (solenoids gave out, not actual wear). $1600. Hardly anything has gone wrong with it aside from minor crap like the power antenna and normal maintainance items that fail like water pumps and starters and so on as it got over ten years old and well over 100K miles.Same story with most GM full-size cars. Big, last forever, and while the looks aren't great, the cars are very reasonable to own. The good thing about the Lucerne CXS and Cadillacs, though, is that the suspension is a lot better than a typical rental car. Also, the rental companies boughty exactly zero CXS models as they were $35K+ new.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=301211938Certified, $20K. Same story with the DTS - tons and tons of examples under $20K. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Looking for a car for 17 year old son. The wrinkle is he'll be putting ~ 500 miles a week (20-25k/yr). This is 2/3 Highway 1/3 Country roads in Ohio Snowbelt. ""Beater"" sounds good in theory, but we also need safe in this case...and the beaters I'm seeing ain't lookin' too safe. Given the miles involved, a high mpg would be great, but we'll give that up over safety & price if necessary. Was hoping for $5-$6k. Any ideas? ",Posts: 11,Member

Probably my best suggestion is a Mazda Protege. Much much cheaper than the Hondyota equivalents and just as reliable. FWD takes care of the snow problem with good tires. Should be able to score one with quite low miles in your price range. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Can't get much for under $6k these days. If you want something with good fuel economy, one idea is a Saturn SL or SC. The steel cage construction is good for crash safety (for a small car), and you can find them under $6k with a lot of life left. If you can find a Protege in good condition, that would make a nice car for a teen also.If you don't mind something bigger (more gas), you could look for something like a Taurus or Century or Malibu. Not exciting, but pretty safe and lots of them around for under $6k. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If you are near a GM dealership, should not be too hard. There's the salvage yards, plus when Saturn wound down GM paid suppliers to make parts that were unique to Saturns. If it's a concern, stick to something like the Taurus or Century or Malibu... lots of those sold, for many years.As for salt... the Saturn SL and SC have those plastic body panels.

Well, 2003 was the last year for them, and those certainly fall within your budget. The LX models are crossing the block at auction right around $3k with 100k'ish miles. So $5k would be more than enough to buy one from a dealer. Find a private party and you should be able to score it for $4k. Lower miles the better, of course, and you just pay a little more.Add about $700-$800 for an ES model.A 2003 Level 2 Saturn Ion sedan with 100k'ish is right there at the same pricing as the Protege. Not a bad choice, but for the same price, I'm getting the Protege, personally.Don't know what to tell you about the rust. You are just going to have to keep looking. Hell, buy out of state if you have to.Was just talking this evening to my in-laws about their daughter turning 17 and needing her first car. Discussed the Protege and Saturn with them, too. I also have them looking for a 325i. Early '90s examples with low miles can also be had for the sub-$4k range. Not sure how those fare in your neck of the woods. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

The previous generation Altima with stickshift and the 4 cylinder engine would be close to ideal. Yes, he may complain, but manual is a valuable skill to learn and he cannot get distracted as easily with a manual as he has to keep his eyes and ears (and hands) in sync the car.A previous generation (or so) Accord with the same setup would also work well. Good mpg and a nice manual that's almost as easy as a video game to use. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

As an insurance agent, I get this sort of question all the time. Customers will ask my opinion on what vehicle they should get for their teenage kids. I keep a list of cars to recommend based (in order of importance) on safety, reliability, performance (as in ""lack of"") and fuel economy. It amazes me how many parents gravitate toward SUVs (especially mid/full-sized ones) thinking they're the best choice of vehcile for their kid!?!? They have a high center-of-gravity, which makes them more prone to rollover and gives them the handling prowess of a parade float. Not to mention the liability risk created by putting a brand new driver behind the wheel of anything weighing close to 3-tons!Here are the vehicles I recommend given your price range and fuel economy preference. All are rated 4/5-stars in frontal impact crash tests and rollover rating.2004-2006 Ford Taurus or Mercury Sable - 20/27mpg with base V6, plenty on the market with under 100,000 miles for under $6k.2003-2006 Toyota Corolla - 25/34mpg 2005-2007 Ford Focus - 23/31mpg2003-2004 Honda Accord 4-cylinder - 21/31mpg - will have well over 100,000 miles in your price range, but not a concern if it has had proper maintenance.2002-2005 Honda Civic (Coupe or Sedan) - 26/35mpg - also will have high miles, same as the Accord.

Good luck finding a 2003-6 Corolla without very high miles for under $6k. Within 100 miles of me, there's two 2003 Corollas under $6k--barely under. One has 169k, the other 198k miles.A 2005-6 Focus is more attainable under $6k, with relatively low miles (for this price range).

I second the Buick option. Either a Century or used LeSabre. Even small towns will have mechanics who can work on them and parts are cheap. They have been very reliable. I have a son who currently has a '98 LeSabre, still going strong. Used Buicks are generally much cheaper than used Toyotas or Hondas and there are many out there.There is a general shortage of used cars right now because people are keeping their cars longer. So a good route is to look for cars that are not that popular but are still reliable and good choices.Saabs, I think repairs could be pricy. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I've got to agree on the no-go Saab option. When they run, they're fantastic, but when they start having problems, they can be an endless money pit. Many moons ago, this was not the case. I had a mid-80's Saab 900 that ran forever and needed no real work (and the work it did need was easy enough to do yourself).Later, I had a Saab 9000. It hadn't hit 100K miles, and it was costing about $800/month in repairs, mostly repeat visits for transmission issues. You can lease just about any luxury car you desire for $800/month!!

I'm giving another nod for the Protege. One of the best cars I ever owned.

I'm wondering if it's a regional thing with supply & demand. There's very little options within a 100 (sometimes 200 mile) radius for any of those cars unless they're very near 200k, or one good sneeze away from tranny failure :mad: To comment on the SUV error: ""been there done that never want to live thru it again"". Put our oldest in a low mileage, company fleet, well maintained ""bulletproof"" Jeep. One morning she (and 3 other drivers on that road) hit snowdrifts blowing across the empty farm field..rolled it onto the roof, hit a phone pole, then rolled rear over front a few times before skidding 200 ft on the roof, hit the ditch & flipped upright. Airbags & seatbelts are wonderful creations. Not a scratch on her tho she felt like she went thru the Spin Cycle one too many times.

Get the Accord, if for no other reason that it has side curtain airbags and the Fusion doesn't. Accords at 94,000 miles are as tight or tighter than a Fusion at half the mileage.

I've shopped for both lately and can tell you that the Fusions are going for about the same as Accords of the same year. Having driven the 2006 Fusion, I'd pick an Accord any day. The Fusion handles fine, but the 4 cylinder is weak and noisy. The car just doesn't feel like it's in the same league as the Accord. More recent Fusions may be better, and the Accord definitely has lost some competitiveness of late. But the 2003-2007 Accords are hard to beat. All models 2005 on have side curtains.

I wouldn't buy a car -- especially a small car -- without side curtain airbags. Check out the IIHS/NHTSA sites to see how much worse drivers and passengers fare in a car without side curtains/side airbags.

Test drove the 2012 camry SE today with navigation and entune. The guy wanted $500 OVER invoice and was peanuts for my trade in. I walked out. The interior seems somewhat improved from 2011. The navi display unit has slightly inferior resolution compared to the hyundai elantra. However after installing an app on your cell phone you can use your phone's internet connection in the car which is cool (similar to ford sync I suppose). It took me a while to get the internet working in the car but it did finally. Incase anyone sees this thread in the future - you need to install the entune app on your cell and register on myentune (free registration). I think they give you 36 mos of free entune service. dunno what they'll charge after that. The voice recognition worked slightly better than the sonata bluelink. It was however slightly slower. I still can't believe that 2012 models are still plagued by slow / poor resolution touch screen displays for navi/audio. It is nice to see that the trim comes with 90 days of free xm radio which worked fairly well. As the reviews indicated the steering is loose/weak. The i4 engine similarly (non cvt, I think) is probably more comparable to a hyundai elantra subjectively (i realize there is a horse power difference). Still quite noisy. Didn't test drive the v6. Despite all this I'd have considered purchasing it at the right price. The 0% 60 mos financing is for the 2011 model. No incentives/rebate for 2012 (atleast none that are announced per the dealership/or I could find). Along the same lines, I can't qualify for the $1000 recent college graduate promo either because they don't have a financing deal. ",Posts: 10,Member

One nice thing about the last generation LeSabre is that the limited trim has a nice HUD which displays the speed. It's quite easy to keep from driving too fast. The leather, decent sound, and other features, like rear A/C vents are also nice. The bench seat option is preferred, though, as it keeps the front seat area much more clean and open feeling (and the center console is 90% as usable). Being able to fit 6 people in a pinch is a nice features as well, since you don't need a minivan.The Park Avenue is all of that and a bit more luxury/options. If you have 3 kids, it will fit them in far more comfort, and the trunk is huge. It suffers 1 mpg for all of that extra size. It's about the same size and weight, and 0-60 time as a Crown Vic, but the engine gets 5-7mpg better economy (I've owned both, verified in actual real-world driving) . Really a win-win situation. Add in the fact that almost none were sold as rentals and 95%+ were sold to old people who hardly drove them, and it's a good used car to consider.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=296083311This is a typical example. In this case, you absolutely want a private party vehicle so that you can determine the history and get paperwork. Most owners will be elderly, be anal about their car, and have a book of paperwork an inch thick, since new. Just be sure to get the supercharger checked out first in the ultra model. They are known to die around 100-120K (not a defect, just wears out - blame Eaton, not GM) and are ~$600 to get a rebuilt one. That said, with a properly working supercharger, the Ultra is 240HP and crazy fast for its size. I'm driving my dad's Ultra currently (bought it from him) and it leaves Accords and Camrys in the dust as it generates most of its torque down low compared to the imports that have to rev their engines to death to get their maximum power. It jumps from, say, 20 to 50 far quicker as a result, unless they absolutely floor their accelerator.(I'm at half throttle by comparison) Pretty fun car for cheap, to run around in. :P ","Posts: 3,738",Member

As far as the precat failure, simply google ""nissan 2.5 precat failure"" to read all about it. Most info is in other forums, so I won't post the links here. Just know that it is a pretty major issue. By law, the emissions equipment is covered to 80k, so Nissan was covering many of these problems up until them.

Hi there. I'm new here and haven't owned a car for 11 years so I'm *really* out of the loop. My small family (myself, husband, and toddler) need to buy a used car in about ten days. We only have about $4500 total (tax and fees, etc) to spend. We don't need much. Good gas millage, good reliability, and four doors is all we need. I thought we needed something like a 2001/2002 Ford Focus, 1998/1999 Toyota Corolla, or a 1996/1997 Honda Accord. Based on my research using the Edmunds TMV I thought these would be good bets for our price range and for what we needed. I also thought that since these are popular cars there would be a lot of them on the market to choose from. This has really not been the case. We live in San Francisco and every place I've contacted will come nowhere near the TMV value for these cars. I'm guess maybe they are so popular, the dealers don't have to worry about selling them. There's no need to give me the price I'm asking if they can sell it for 1-2K more tomorrow or next week. I need some suggestions on what to do and where to start. What cars should I consider to get what we need at this price? I'm really at a loss. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ",Posts: 11,Member

Again, I'm going to recommend cheap and domestic. And I have the perfect cheap as dirt and reliable as a tank car for you. Nobody wants it, yet it's acceptable transportation what won't get stuck on those hills, either.What is the one car that GM made that is the least desireable because of its image and because of the brand being ""dead"", yet it's mechanically reliable?Look at a Pontiac Grand Prix. Get one with the 3.8L engine in it. It's the same old engine and transmission combo that GM made for 20+ years and it's pretty much trouble-free. Looks are a bit meh, but it gets good mpg ~26-28mpg highway, about 22-24mpg combined depending on how you drive it) and is fairly large and safe in a crash. Cheap as dirt to insure as well. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/2606080221.htmlTypical private party example. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/2620686240.htmlOr you can get this. It looks like it's well maintained and the car is very nice to drive. Expect 27-28mph highway as well - it's basically a Buick version of the Grand Prix.

You are worried about resale value in two years for a car you will pay $3k for? Why? But the concern over maintenance costs is real. Pick the car that has the best condition, and most new/newer wear parts: brakes, shocks/struts, tires, exhaust system/converter, etc. Also if you can get maintenance records on either car that would be huge. You say the Malibu looks to be in pristine condition, so that might be very important. Is he the original owner, and has all the records?If possible, have a good mechanic check out the car to make sure there isn't anything major wrong with it. Will cost you a few bucks but could save you a lot more. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Ditto what backy said.In 2 years, the resale value is going to be pretty much independent of the make/model, and more related to the condition and mileage. If it still runs in 2 years, it's a $1500-ish vehicle, slightly more or less depending on wear & tear. If it doesn't run, it's a $500 vehicle for parts.Have them both checked out, the pick the one you like the best. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

 Hello, I really need help deciding what to lease as nothing I can afford is really standing out to me. Which is disappointing. I currently have a 2009 Honda Accord Coupe EX-L. It has low miles (23K) and I've had to have the brake pads fixed 3 times! To me, that is unacceptable. Honda dealers tell me they have fixed the brake issue, but then, they are trying to sell cars. I need to know from those who have a 2011/12 Honda if the brakes still squeal, etc. and have this issue. The choices are: 2012 Honda Accord coupe V6 2012 Acura TSX 4 cyl. 2012 Kia Optima SX2012 Buick Regal TURBO The Kia is the only one I have not test driven. I would have loved to have gotten a Mustang V8, but can't afford the lease and the V6 was underpowered IMO. I also test drove the VW CC and was appalled at the amount of throttle lag. I can't believe Edmunds never commented on that in their review. To me, acceleration is unpredictable and unsafe. Again, would have leased a CC in a heartbeat but for that unseamless turbo. If anyone can recommend something I have not thought of, or if you feel that Honda has improved brake quality enough to recommend the V6, by all means do so! Basically I'm looking for something on the sportier side of handling with good safety.Thank you for any suggestions... ",Posts: 20,Member

I would have loved to have gotten a Mustang V8, but can't afford the lease and the V6 was underpowered IMO.You lost me here, too. The 2012 V6 Mustang will run circles around all the other cars you listed. Did you drive a 2011?? ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I have test driven everything but the Optima. I test drove the V6 and it was fun, perhaps the dealer did have me drive a 2011. However, my 190 hp Accord outran a Mustang V6 believe it or not! The reason I am replacing the car is because basically it isn't my choice. My father is helping me out and he is calling the shots. What we are dealing with here is a chronic leasee and therefore he apparently is getting me into his situation since I'm not able to do this on my own unfortunately. I have been trying to seek out a different model car this whole time then the Accord, but again, nothing has really grabbed me except the stronger engines that are obviously more difficult to afford. Maybe I need to re-drive the Mustang and make sure its a 2012. Other then that, I have to say the TSX's suspension felt the sturdiest, if maybe a little bland in the feel of the drive. Remember, I'm looking at the 4 cylinder not the 6. Thank you everyone for the feedback! Much appreciated. ",Posts: 20,Member

The 2011 and earlier stang V6 was a very antiquated 4 liter 240hp lump. The 2012 is a completely new 300 hp (meaning as much power as the previous GT model), does 0-60 in well under 6 secs (no stock Accord ever built can touch it), AND gets 30mpg highway. Its a pretty impressive ""entry level"" package. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Plus, it's inexpensive. Though, you really do want one with manual unless you are so weak and old that you can't use your left leg.

Nah, it's technique. :P You have to seriously get into the ""I don't care"" big trucker mode. Pick a gear. stay in it and ignore the surrounding traffic during a jam. Stay7 in 1st or 2nd gear and shift as little as possible. Ignore distance between yourself and the cars around you. That is, don't care about if it's 10 or 30 ft between you and the car in front.Traffic jams are a snap. The last one I was in I shifted a total of 6 times in 30 minutes. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

FWIW, I have a 2009 TSX, and have had to replace the rear brake pads twice, rear rotors warped/replaced once ($700 total in brake repair costs), and the car only has 34k miles. It also feels underpowered to me, lots of hesitation in the transmission, imo. The dealer said that was normal. I don't believe I will get another one when my lease is up. I can't recommend it, but maybe the brake problems have been fixed in the 2012 model, who knows. It's a really pretty car. ",Posts: 90,Member

I understand what you're saying kdshapiro. However, it's interesting to hear that and something I've seen is a problem with Acura's, at least the TSX's. This is the same problem with my Honda. They do have an issue with the pads wearing down too fast compared to other car manufacturers, Honda/Acura. It's the only problem I had with my car, but 3x changed under 23K miles is a bit much. It's safe to say that even though every car co. will have a lemon handed out here and there, if the majority of consumers have had similar negative issues with a car, we should probably listen  As for the clutch issue, I hear you on the coasting concept, but I have knee problems, so until I can afford a weekend car, tiptronic it is for daily needs!

Apparently the problems with the 2009 TSX brake pads are widespread enough that there was a class action lawsuit, which Acura settled. Something about the type of pads used. If you google it you'll find lots of information. But, even after the bad pads on my car were replaced with the so-called good pads, I still had to have them replaced again within 6 months, plus the warped rotors. The dealer couldn't explain why the rotors warped, said it was not due to the pads, just happens sometimes, normal wear and tear. I did get a $150 reimbursement on the pads by filing a claim under the class action (which the dealer didn't mention to me, I found out about it when I started researching the brake problems, after spending $700). I would like to know if the brake problems have been addressed since 2009. I've been looking at other cars, but it is hard to beat the TSX on value, it's just a nice car for the money, except for the brakes. ",Posts: 90,Member

I'm trying to decide between a 2012 Subaru legacy, and a 2012 Toyota Camry SE. My friend works at a subaru dealer and he said he could get me a leather wrapped legacy for around 24k OTD. But I'm not sure if that's with a nav and a sunroof. The awd is nice but I don't think I'll use it much. The legacy is roomy too which is especially good for me since I'm very very tall. I really like the look of the new camry and I was offered a little bit over 27k OTD with nav backup camera sun roof but no leather. I'm somewhat of a tech guy so the iPod features and pandora and bing apps in the Camry really have me excited. The Camry however is pretty expensive for me. I've heard that camrys haven't been all that reliable in the past and I don't know too much about subarus. Which car has the best resale value?

Hey, I'm somewhat middle aged & weak on my left side and can't use my left leg to shift due to my on the job injury so I'd have to say go with the auto Mustang if that's what you'd like. But in this case, I'd go with the 2008 TSX and be done with it...a very sweet ride with all the bells & whistles...unfortunately your situation obviously is different. The Mazda3 with the Skyactive engine would probably be the lowest priced car for ya & they are fun cars to toss around...we own an S model and it's a hoot to drive!Shame you can't get off the leasing merry go round as one never owns anything this way.

I don't know where you heard Camry's weren't reliable, but it's not an accurate statement.

My mother has 90K on her LeSabre and it has had virtually nothing go wrong with it, either. That said, Toyota never has made a very reliable V6 engine, and their automatic transmissions are upwards of $4K for a replacement. Their claim to fame, worldwide, has always been 4 cylinder cars and their manual transmissions. If you get one with both, you'll have the doors rust off before it dies. Honda also is similar in that I'd take a 4 cylinder Accord over the V6 as the 4 is better. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

What the dealer may tell you as ""warped rotors"" may or may not be warped. Honda pads are known for material buildup on the rotors which will show symptoms the same as rotors that are warped. Your option is to get new rotors and 3rd party pads (Autozone's Gold CMAX brake pads, Hawks or EBC Greenstuff) or live with it. I have been living with this issue for a good part of over 10 years on various Hondas. I may switch but I would prefer silent pads over even the slightest squealing which at least most Honda pads do not do.You should really learn to change these yourself. They are simple to do and will then ask yourself why are you paying $150 labor to do something you can do in 30-60 minutes on your own. ",Posts: 33,Member

Toyota's V6s throughout its history have been rather hit and miss. Certainly nothing special. GM, especially, managed to always do better in fuel economy and power out of their same displacement models. In many cases, the Toyota V6s were only a little more powerful than their 4s. 30-40 extra HP out of the V6, yet slower to rev and another 250-300lbs of dead weight to the equation. The newest Toyota GZ series engines are good. But you really do want to avoid the older VZ (gutless and prone to mechanical issues) and MZ engines (sludge, other issues), which are in many models until 2006-2008 or so, so that affects a lot of CPO and similar models that people might consider without realizing that they are potentially getting into transmission (somewhat unavoidable) *and* engine issues as the car ages. But their 4 cylinder engines are great. As are their few inline 6 engines. And as for manuals, my last Toyota ate its input bearings and 4th gear sprocket at ~340K miles. $1200 for a brand new manual (not rebuilt) and I was good to go again. The clutch was $150 for the part. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

The CTS is a drastic departure for GM and is one car that is worth buying new. It'll handle better and go faster that 99% of normal people can deal with and it's a lot less expensive than Mercedes and BMW's offerings.No, it's no 3 series. But it handily beats the E class and 5 series in price and overall usability. Plus, repairs are a lot less expensive. Add in a good interior and looks that make it clear from two blocks away that you're not driving a jellybean-mobile. Remember the days when everyone knew what brand you drove a quarter mile away? It's worth a look at least. P.S. If you have that much money, there's also the CTS-V, but it's quite honestly a bit silly. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

You can get the 3.0L model and save a TON of money. The 3.6 is a better car, but it's also completely absurd as well outside of Europe, since Canada has fairly low speed limits. The 3.0L has 270HP and is more than enough.For a 2011 CTS 3.0L AWD Luxury (quoted via truecar), it's $36,769. That's in USD, but it gives you a good idea of how much less you can get one for. For a same trim 2012 with the 3.6L engine, they quote $47,959 - a bit over $11K more. Based upon a few sites I found in Canada that were similar, you should be looking at about $45-47K for the same car in Canada. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi guys, first post on the forum, had a question to throw at the real car enthusiasts. I'm 17, a junior in high school, and am getting my first car. I live in Southern Ohio. My 'dilemma'. My parents said they would get my a car under about 23,000 with a little wiggle room here and there. They would love for me to get a Honda Accord (sedan), 2012. However, I want to make sure its my best option.They also like the 2012 new CRV but I want to stick with a 4 door sedan.After my own research these seem like the best options:2012 HONDA ACCORD: Our neighbor works for Honda and said he can get us a deal if we buy a Honda, so the I would be able to get the Accord at a reduced rate, probably 8-12% off the sticker price, so that means the EX-L line would fall into this category, but the V6 or navigation systems would still be too much. I like the Accord, its looks aren't awful but don't wow or turn heads. Its drive is smooth but its not really a performance car or anything, even with the 190hp. 2009-10 ACURA TSX: I like the TSX a lot, as in its body design is aggressive without being over the top and flashy. It's a bit smaller than the Accord so it should get more pep to its drive and be able to park better, right? Its got a 201 hp (once again, v6 would be too much $) and I think that should perform better than the Accord's. The interior of an 09 is almost comparable to the Accord ex-l so I don't feel like I'm losing much. From my research, it would still be sub 24k if I was to take a no tech package, or with serious haggling I could get it. 2008 LEXUS IS250: The 250 seems to the funnest to drive, without giving up any real safety or usability features. Considering I'll be in college soon, i don't see the need for a large back seat, by the time I have any sort of family this car will be 200k miles an ready for retirement (at the least!). The v6 engine seems to be a nice feature as well. As far as the interior goes, its a bit smaller than the accord and tsx but has the same major features, leather seats, steering wheel mounted controls, heated seats etc. Correct me if I'm wrong.My main problem is this: This is the only car my parents will pay for, after this, it's all my own hard earned cash. That being said, I want this to be a car that can last me through the next two years of high school, and if needed, in college and definitely out of college. Having a neighbor with Honda, I think I would be able to get better maintainability and of course, better pricing on a new Accord. It would also have 0 miles on it. The TSX, judging by autotrader.com's prices would have about 15-20k miles and the Lexus, 30-35k. They would also be a few years old, 3 and 4 respectively. Should I just stick with the Accord? I would prefer driving the Lexus, or even TSX but is it worth having a 30k 4 year old car right off the bat? Any input would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for anyone who even took the time to read all of that! ",Posts: 1,Member

A new Honda will have a 3-year warranty that neither of your other options will have, plus you will know the history of the car since you will have owned it since new. Hondas are fun to drive as long as you realize that the Honda is not & will never be a hot rod or rice rocket. You may like the looks of an Accord coupe over the sedan--be sure to check that out.That said, do yourself a big favor and DO NOT buy a Honda with a V6 (with automatic), as the VCM system on Honda's V6 engines is really poor technology and will give you much more grief & frustration than the 4 cylinder.

My advice to you (even though you probably don't want to hear it as I wouldn't at your age) is to get something a bit older as you will likely dent the heck out of it by you or someone else. Unless your parents are super rich, you are better saving that money for a nice car when you graduate college.I would suggest going for a 06 or 07 Accord as it will probably be the least cost on your parents and insurance (and IMO is a better car overall compared to the current generation)Oh and your friend who works for Honda may not be getting the best deal around so it is best to find out the price and check around dealers first.I'll be honest with the current generation Accord, the seats suck. They hurt my back on long trips. The interior has too many buttons. And while they fixed the rear pads I am not sure how much extended life you will get out them. When my sister had her 08, I was replacing the pads every 15k miles. Luckily I do them myself so I only pay $50 for the pads while others pay $150-200 for a dealer to do them.She ended up with most of the TSBs published and had two failed door actuators (search the web for these) before 40k miles. She was fed up with all of the minor problems and traded it in for a 09 Altima. The car has 50k miles, just replaced both sets of pads, and only had one blown fuse (probably overloaded the accessory socket). The car was night and day compared to her Accord.We have had Hondas in our family for over 14 years. We need a new car and it won't be an Accord. ",Posts: 33,Member

First, you should realize how lucky you are to have parents who would buy you such a nice car while you are still in high school. Be thankful for that (especially today) and tell them ""Thank you!"" and give them a big hug. Then honor them and their generosity by taking very good care of the car and driving it safely.As to the car... I think you realize the Accord is the most Practical choice, and the Lexus is the most Fun choice. The TSX splits the difference. You could get an Acura Certified TSX, or a Lexus Certified IS, and have the factory warranty. One thing I encourage you to check out is an Acura Certified 2008 TSX. That is the last year of the previous design but they are considered by many to be superior to the current design, and it will cost far less than $23k. So you could get a top-notch sample with lowest possible miles and save your parents some bucks, which they could apply to your auto insurance (which will be a LOT for the next few years). I think you would enjoy driving the TSX more than the Accord, and it's more compact than the Accord thus easier to park in crowded school parking lots. That's how I would go if it were my choice between these 3 cars. (If it were really my choice, I'd ask my parents to let me consider a hatchback because of its practicality for to/from college, e.g. Focus or Mazda3, also its fuel efficiency. They might compliment you on your practicality.). In fact, I will be making that choice in the next year or so--buy a new compact car ala Focus for around $18k, or buy a 2008 TSX. Good luck!

..and, it sort of is... I have a 17 yr old... I'd buy an $8000 car now, and ask them to hold the other $15K for when you get out of college... Buying a new car will be a waste.. your warranty will expire in three years, with very little mileage driven. For the mileage that a typical teenager drives, you could buy a 6 year old sedan, and it should keep you through college... When you get your first job out of college, then you can sell your heap, add the $15K, take a small loan, and have a new car that will be serviceable as long as you need it, or until you can afford a newer/better model.. at a time, when you'll really need a new car, and most new graduates can't afford it..My son drives 2 miles each way to school... wouldn't waste a new car on that commute, even if I were willing to buy him a new car (which I'm not).Where do you have to go in Chillicothe?

The problem with that idea is, there's very little in the way of a good sedan from 2005 or newer under $8,000. I just did a search within 30 miles of me for sedans with those qualifications and under 100k miles. I found 3: a 2006 Sentra S with 77k miles (good little car, economical at least), a 2005 Impala with 83k miles, and a 2007 Saturn Ion with 95k miles. That's it. There may be others out there, but the fact is $8,000 doesn't buy much of a car anymore. I have a feeling these parents aren't struggling financially. If they were, I'd agree that it's better to buy a cheap car now. But if the parents want to give their son a nice car... what's it to us? Then the car will be usable all the way through college and for a few years after college. And we know not everyone gets a great job right out of college, so it's good to have a solid car that's paid for when exiting college. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I don't see his parents finances entering into the decision... They are willing to spend $23K.... and, likely won't spend any more for his automobile needs.... ever.So, my advice was what would be best financially for him. (IMO, of course).. He only gets the $23K, one time... I wouldn't spend it all now..Most good $8000 cars aren't on autotrader... you buy them from friends or neighbors.. Every teenager on my street has a sub-$8000 car. It's just a waste of resources to buy an expensive car for the driving needs of a high school student.. If I had those same driving needs, I wouldn't buy a new car for myself... :surprise: regards,kyfdx ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

Our HOST gave you the best advice in my opinion.For under 10,000 you can buy a great used car. So what if it's out of warranty? If something breaks, just have it fixed.Take the extra 15,000 and invest it somewhere and watch it grow.As far as a V-6 Accord. they are NOT troublesome cars just totally unnecessary. The 4's have more than ample power.Civic or Accord, You can't go wrong! If you do go used just make sure it gets a total inspection.Probably not what you wanted to hear, I know!

I didn't read that there was an option to take $23k cash and do whatever he wanted with it. If that's the case, I would definitely buy a less expensive car, not a $23k sedan. There's some very nice NEW cars perfect for a student in the $15-16k range. And some very nice used cars with factory warranty/certified warranties (if that is important) in the $12-15k range.I thought the decision needed to be between a new Accord, a used TSX, or a used IS. That was how I replied.I let my oldest son use my six-year-old 626 when he was finishing junior year in high school. Cost me $7k. He drove it through college, then I turned the title over to him for his graduation gift and then sold it for around $3200 a few months ago, and applied that towards a 2007 Accord SE sedan. He should get a lot of miles out of that. My other son is driving my 2004 Elantra GT hatch, purchased new, to college now (sophomore). When he graduates it will be just over 10 years old but will probably have 80k miles on it or less. Still runs and looks new (except for a few dings). I'll turn the title over to him when he graduates. He wants to be a high school teacher so he'll probably need to hang onto it for awhile after college--they don't make real big bucks. It's worth about $6000-6500 now.So yes, there's some good sub-$8000 cars out there. But not a lot of them, since prices have skyrocketed in the past year or two. And not the question that was asked.

I wonder how your folks survived on $3,900 a year, which was the average annual income in the USA in 1952? Or maybe they were rich and made all of, say, $5,000 a year. Some of the kids at the high school my boys went to had Audis, BMWs, Volvos, newer Hondas, etc. etc.--all or almost all gifts from parents I'll wager. Those parents obviously had different thoughts than I did when it came to providing a car to their kids for school. Well, it's their money. Hope their kids appreciated their parents' generosity.

Regarding your concern about excessive magnetic fields in a Hybrid, I've had a EMF meter in the past, as a worker in an Electric Generating Plant, I had concerns.I was relieved to find that my office, which was less than 100' from a 120mw generator, had only background EMF's .You can buy one from Amazon or Home Depot for $25-30The range on mine went from sub 2mg to 30mgMontana, I believe, is the only state to have a EMF TWA average of 2mg in an 8 hr period.Bringing me to my point, steel belted tires at highway speeds generate a pretty hefty magnetic field. I suggest getting one and check your Hybrid's and non-Hybrid cars on the Interstate to see what the passengers are subject to.link titleA few years back lots of people were concerned about living ""near"" high tension power lines [500k Volts+]I tested the ""right-of-way"" near some of our 230k lines and the meter showed only ""background"" EMF's until I crossed the boundary of the R.O.W.When I got into the right of way, the meter suddenly went to 30mg Outside it, ZERO.I also checked every item in the home, we've all heard about ceiling fans and hairdryers putting off excess EMF's, True but to be in ""the field"" of a ceiling fan, you have to stand in a chair, or on the coffee table.Hairdryer, sure it's Hot, but just like any radiation, the TWA [Time Weighted Average]or exposure rate vs time of exposure is what counts. One hazard in the home is NOT obvious.The little transformers, like your cordless phone, drill, cell, kids low voltage toys etc.Those little black boxes, plugged into a 110v outlet, put out a full 30mg within a foot or less. Beyond 2', Zero mg on the meter..Lots of beds have a AC outlet with these plugged into them, right by the headboard, THIS IS A HAZARD,,, especially to Children."">link title.A simple and cheap fix for this, buy a $5.00 Multi-Outlet strip and move the transformer away from the headboard. I've warned anyone who'd listen.EMF's can be dangerous, given a large enough dose over a long enough time span, hence the term TWA.DrVetteBTW, remember when Mom griped about sitting too close to the TV..Back in the days before LCD or Plasma tv's they all were CRT, Cathode Ray Tube.Guess what a CRT emits ?Gamma Rays, Mom was RIGHT !!

There are a number of new cars under $15,000. The Hyundai Accent comes to mind. New basic cars have a good warranty, get great mileage now, and used as ex-rentals with 30k miles rarely cost a lot less than new ones. I foolishly bought a new 2011 Malibu (26k list - I paid 22) when I could have bought the identical 2009 for about $12k with around 30k miles. I'll keep it till 2015 and get a used certified Cadillac XTS or an Avalon. If I was getting a teenager a car I'd look at either a new subcompact like an Accent or a 2009-10 Cobalt coupe for around $11 watching for one with low mileage under 30k. The Cobalt has more standard equipment than an Accent and looks neater especially in red or yellow. I have a 2009 that has been trouble free and gets great gas mileage. ",Posts: 299,Member

HiI am debating between buying a brand new Altima or Sonata GLS (automatic transmission).I test drove both, and liked them both equally - although the Altima seemed more roomy on the front/passenger seats. The Sonata had slightly better gadgets for the base model (heated side mirrors, ipod dock) and also better interior storage I also test drove an Accord, but the price difference makes me lean towards either Altima or Sonata.We are expecting an addition to our family this year, so two very important thing for us is child seat & trunk space. Since we do not own a child seat, we were unable to put one in and see how they fit and how much room it leaves in the rear..Can someone comment on which car is better for these two requirements?

I recommend the 2012 Hyundai Sonata GLS for several reasons.SPACE- The Sonata's passenger volume (interior space) is 104 cu ft, compared to 101 cu ft for the Altima. The Sonata's trunk has 16.4 cu ft of space vs. 15.3 cu ft for the Altima. WARRANTY- Hyundai- Basic- 5yr/60k, Powertrain- 10yr/100k, Roadside Assistance- 5yr/UnlimitedNissan- Basic- 3yr/36k, Powertrain- 5yr/60k, NO Roadside Assistance FUEL ECONOMY- Hyundai- 24/35mpg vs. Nissan- 23/32mpgSAFETY- Both cars are very safe, but the Sonata performed better in the rear-impact collision test conducted by the IIHS. It evaluates the performance of the design of the seat and head-restraint in low to moderate speed rear impacts. The Altima was rated as Acceptable, while the Sonata earned the highest rating of Good.For 2012, all Sonatas have a new feature called BlueLink. It is a telematics system similar to OnStar in basic concept. It will automatically transmit the GPS coordinates in the event of a collision or if you call Roadside Assistance via the system. Functions such as voice navigation, remote unlock, remote start, maintenance alerts, stolen vehicle tracking and weather/traffic are also offered for a slightly higher annual fee ($79, $179 or $279/year).One of my co-workers has a 2011 Sonata GLS and she loves it! Her only regret is that she didn't get the GLS Popular Equipment Package. For only $750, it includes Power Adjustable Driver's Seat w/ Lumbar, 16"" Alloy Wheels, Automatic headlight control and Upgraded Door Panel trim. I would highly recommend it for the wheel upgrade alone! =)Good luck and congrats on the kiddo! ",Posts: 801,Member

The other thing is, if you are planning to buy one of these soon, do it by Jan. 2 as both Hyundai and Nissan have year-end incentives. For example, I am visiting in Central TX this week and a dealer in the Austin area is advertising $3000 off MSRP on Sonatas, not including the Military rebate which is $500 additional off. I know Nissan has year-end specials also. And the other thing is, since both the Altima and Sonata have been around awhile in present form, you could save a lot of money by buying a slightly used car. With the Sonata, you could get one 1-2 years old and still have a lot of warranty left.On fuel economy... although the Altima's EPA ratings are a little less than the Sonata's, I've found the Altima 2.5 with CVT is very efficient for a mid-sized car. I rented one last week (had only 1600 miles on it) and drove it over a few days and several hundred miles, and it averaged 35 mpg with mostly highway miles but also some city driving in the Chicago suburbs and Milwaukee.

Have to agree that the Sonata I rented for a few days in Florida made me conclude it's not one I'd pick in this group. Steering was no fun at all -- no road feel, no responsiveness. Seats hurt. Front passenger seat was low and couldn't be raised. Noise was higher than I was expecting. I think the car's getting such great reviews mainly because it looks great and comes with a long list of features and is a significant step up from its predecessor.

Like many others, I was debated Sonata vs. Altima and others top contenders in mid-size sedan category. I really wanted to like the Hyundai more. Drove it and saw the overall value--they pack a lot of features in standard, as other have said. But in the end I just felt underwhelmed by the fit and finish and, to my eyes anyway, I thought it was trying a bit too hard with the space-age look. Exterior I liked more than interior. Drove the 2012 Turbo. Plenty quick and certainly not a bad car. But just not my car. I kind of feel that there was TOO much going on with respect to the info centre (radio/nav/etc.). I found it distracting. I'm sure after a week, or less, of driving it I'd sort those points out, but I just found myself wondering whether I'd grow tired of the overall ""look."" And I would like to keep the car for at least 5 years. So we're looking at the Altima 3.5. Was considering Honda too, but Accord seems overpriced for what you get. I suppose, in the end, you won't go too far wrong with any of the solid contenders here. ",Posts: 1,Member

If you like the Accord, I suggest you try to email all ALTIMA dealers to see how low they can get. Whatever is the lowest, you can assume that you can take that quote to a different dealer and have it beat by ATLEAST $500 (may be more). Based on what I have been seeing on the forum lately, I believe you will be able to negotiate to around $18.5k for a 2.5S base.Then see what kind of premium you may want to pay for an Accord with comparable features, and go to the dealer and offer them lower than that target price. I'd think that the Honda brandname would atleast command a $1000 premium, so you may want to set your target to around 19.5k, and offer them initially 19k. Stick to your guns, and prepare to walk if they do not get any close to your target price. If they agree, you walk off with a car you want.. otherwise you just lose few hours trying to haggle.Just my $0.02.. Over the years, I have learnt that you can really haggle at the dealership if you have a target price in mind. You have nothing to lose, since the salesman who spent hours negotiating the deal would hate to see you walk away without him getting any commission. ",Posts: 40,Member

Hey guys, I've been looking for a used car for a good 4 or 5 months since I sold my 2001 GMC Sierra. I'm a car guy and 6'6'' so legroom and headroom is always a problem and I have been wanting to get something that is a little more fun to drive and better for hauling people than my truck was. My budget is around $10,000-$11,000 but can go a little higher if need be. I've somewhat narrowed it down to either a 2008 Accord or a 2005 Magnum R/T for the primary reason of both being very comfortable and reliable. My mom has an 8th gen Accord so I've spend a fair amount of time driving it and know pretty well what to expect. Here is my pros and cons for each carAccord Pros:Newer yearNicer interiorTighter steering and overall responseBetter gas mileageLighterAccord Cons:More expensiveLess of an enthusiast vehicleSlower FWDMagnum Pros:FasterMore usable cargo capacityRWDMore aggressive lookingV8 torqueMagnum Cons:Some front end issues (tie rods, struts)Bad mpgCheaper interiorHeavier Let me know what you think or any other vehicle ideas. Some other cars I've considered are Volvo S80, Saab 9-5 and I briefly owned a 2006 VW GLI but sold it because it was too small inside. ",Posts: 1,Member

If you are looking for fun, that rules out the Accord. Trust me on this. I made the mistake with a V6 6-speed Accord and what you think you can live with as ""fun"" wears thin eventually. Took me about 6 months, but I grew to hate mine.If mileage is at all a concern, say goodbye to the Magnum.A $10k S80 is not an S80 you want. That would put you in a previous gen T6, which has horrible reliability, not the least of which is a notoriously faulty transmission.Saab? Well, not my cup of tea, personally. I don't find it very nice inside. Of course, you are still dealing with FWD in that one, too. Not that I have a problem with FWD. It is good when done right.Honestly, large, reliable, frugal, and fun ... for $10k... is a REAL tough combination to hit. I mean, my personal choice is a low-mileage E39 5-series, but I can't stand by the ""reliability"" on that one. It CAN be reliable, if properly maintained, which is not cheap to do.I might look for a 3.5 Altima. Reason I chose the Accord is because I wanted a stick. That's obviously not a concern for you, so I think the Altima would be much more fun. Avoid the 2.5, though. It does have faults. Look for a Maxima if you really need more room, but the Altima is just as big as the Accord inside, I believe.Could also search for a Legacy GT, but I'm not sure you could find a turbo model in your pricerange.

The Azera is going to have a couple of the downsides of the 8th-generation Accord that he listed -- FWD, not an enthusiast's car. It's kind of the Buick of Hyundai. Comfortable and quiet, but numb steering. It's nice and large inside, though.I love the Mazda3, but if he can't fit in the GTI, I'm wondering if the 3 would be any better. The Mazda6 is relatively small on the inside until the second generation -- 2008 or 2009, can't remember which. The first generation was an enthusiast's car, but the engines weren't great. The second is more like the Azera.I've never driven one, but I've read good things about the Saturn Aura. One of the versions is sportier than the others. Because Saturn is no more, prices might be good. And along those lines, how about the Pontiac G8 -- RWD, intended to compete with BMW. Or the newer Pontiac GTO? All three of these would be relatively rare, but maybe worth seeking out.  ",Posts: 50,Member

The second is more like the Azera. Uh... not really.The current Mazda6 is like the Azera in the following ways:* Both have engines.* Both have four wheels/tires.* Both are 4-door sedans.* Both are quite roomy.That's about where the similarity ends. The Mazda6 starts at around $20k new and is a competitor for cars like the Sonata and Accord... not the Azera. The Mazda6 handles much better than the Azera; it's pretty nimble for a mid-sized sedan, even with its bump in size for the current generation.The closest competitor to the Azera I can think of is the Avalon. And maybe the defunct Lucerne. The new Azera may change that, but to my knowledge it's not at dealers yet.I also like the last-gen Mazda6. Nice and trim outside, but enough back seat room for most people. And a good buy as a used car.If sheer passenger room is critical, it would be a good idea to check out the new Passat--which has tons of leg room. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

My personal recommendation would be an IS300 with manual transmission. It's going to drive worlds better than an Accord and it's as close to a Japanese E36 as ever was made. Just it won't break your bank keeping it running. Yes, it's not a large car, but it's very good and whether it fits you or not really depends upon the seat and steering wheel layout. Some people who are as tall as you have to problems, some don't fit. It's worth at least sitting in and trying out.My second choice would be a 2004 Pontiac GTO with manual. Big, RWD, loads of fun, and 30mpg highway. Just that year and transmission combination, though. In 2005, they moved to a new engine and transmission and killed the MPG right into the floor (average 5 mpg drop!). But for $10-12K, you can get essentially a Corvette that seats 4 people and just looks different on the outside. Fast, total ""sleeper"", and way more fun than you'd believe. As for the car, it was made in Australia, so quality is actually very good. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_MonaroNote at the bottom where it got Top Gear's muscle car award.

The IS300 may be more fun than an Accord, but servicing due to Lexus parts will be expensive. In addition, the op never said if there is a climate issue, eg snow, that might preclude some RWD mitigation.I would stay away from Pontiac, there is a reason they are no more. An 8 year old GTO is just begging to separate you from your money. And what about that in-town mileage? Driving the LIE or the 405 rush hour not likely to win the Prius economy awards.Maybe a Subauru AWD is needed? They can be fun to drive, less expensive than IS and more reliable then Pontiac.

The IS300 is actually the least expensive Lexus, ever, when it comes to servicing it. It's not as hideous as you'd think, and the thing really does last forever before breaking down.With that GTO, it was the last year that they put the LS1 engine in pretty much anything. All of the kinks were worked out, and the thing is bulletproof. The issues came from the new engine and 50 extra HP in the 2005+ models. And idiots who added extra HP and then wondered why their rear ends blew out. 350HP and 30mpg highway was awesome and GM should have left it alone.With manual, it's super easy to skip a few gears and get good mpg in-town. It's not stellar, but it's certainly a lot better than most other full-size cars. And a LOT better than the Magnum he mentioned. note - since he mentioned a Dodge Magnum, I figured RWD was not a problem, and neither was crazy high MPG. He probably just doesn't want to be stuck with 18-19mpg like most of these boats deliver.I'll add another option for him, which IS inexpensive and reliable, if a bit boring. He should look at a 2005 Park Avenue. It'll give him 23-24 mpg combined (19/28 window sticker), and is a very solid car. It's one of the few cars from that era that GM essentially over-built. It's certainly a lot nicer to drive than a Camry, and the seats are superb. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I have the choice between 3 cars listed below that I'm considering. This will be for our 18yr old who will mainly use for school and work, occasional weekend 1-2hr longish trips. 99 Saturn SL2 4-D 97000 miles. Owner says has new transmission. Has engine light on, though owner says that's only due to the locking gas cap he installed. Test drive went very well. Car could use a good cleaning. Didn't appear to need any repairs or maintenance in the near future. Was willing to go down to $1850 for it. Young driver probably early 20's. 00 Saturn SL2 4-D 134000 miles. Owner won't budge under $2000. Appeared in great shape - no engine lights on - only ""oddity"" was a slight whistling type of sound I heard coming from engine area when driving. Almost like a person whistling type of sound, or a sound where you are using a ham radio, but the radio wasn't on and the windows were up. Rode nice - just had that sound.99 Lumina 4-D 113000 miles. 2 owner car, very well maintained and in nearly immaculate condition. Asking $2000 - may go to $1700. The only thing I could tell it needed was 2 newer tires. Also, when you shift out of and into park that bar felt very stiff (automatic car - bar that you pull to get in/out of park, drive, reverse). Our daughter is tiny - maybe 5'2"" and maybe 110 lbs. She works at Panera Bread and her hours vary. She's concerned about affording the gas but ultimately wants something that just gets her where she's going. I want something I don't have to worry about fixing a bunch of things on. Currently she is driving our 2001 Chrysler Town and Country and we all know that's NOT good on gas lol....

You absolutely need to get her a car with a manual transmission. Even if she complains. Besides the vastly lower cost to fix, and get better gas mileage, the skills she will learn will be incredibly useful. Most of all, though, she'll have to spend time and attention on DRIVING. Both hands occupied, listening to the machine, and knowing how to really and truly operate it.Now, you seem to like GM. That's fine, but the problem is that GM cars of that era are plainly only a tiny bit better than a Chrysler as the electrical and accessory parts start to cause big bills as they approach 15 years. What you need is solid, reliable, and inexpensive. Manual, of course, is preferred, as is an under $2K price(apparently).You need to go old. Really older. You need a bulletproof tank that is cheap and was overbuilt. ie - a ""classic"", or one that will be in a decade or so, but that isn't right now.A perfect example is a late 80s to early 90s 4Runner with manual and a 4 cylinder engine. It's dead simple to run, big and safe, and hauls stuff. Cheap as dirt to fix, as well. Literally half the cost or less of those Saturns. My old one that I had made it to nearly 400K before I sold it.http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lgb/cto/2813393967.htmlThis is a typical example. Any money you put into it to keep it running will be minor or amounts that she can afford.Also consider small/midsize trucks:http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/cto/2807963015.htmlGets 18/23. Not bad, considering.Another good example is a 1990-1993 (last year made) Volvo 240. These are bulletproof, safe, and amazingly fun to drive with stick. Good MPG, and superb seating and driving position and feedback. Airbags were standard starting in 1990, so it's a real hidden low-cost gem. Repairs are dirt cheap as well since they re-used components for roughly 25 years in the 100/200 series. The Volvo 940 is essentially the exact same vehicle with a fancier interior. Of course, I'd spend more money and just get something like this:http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sgv/cto/2813774414.html$3500 will get you a decent and pretty new vehicle. Yes, it's a dealer posing as a private party, but dealers can be good as they HAVE to make sure it passes basic safety and smog before selling it. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

You absolutely don't have to get a manual transmission. WTF??? You should get what she is comfortable with. I would not get a car from the 80's as they do not have the safety elements of later cars, especially air bags. Manual transmission cars are very hard to sell if you want to get rid of it later. Any of these cars might be good possibilities but with their mileage I would get them all checked out by a mechanic you trust. ""Doesn't appear"" is not a good gauge as many problems aren't apparent on sight or even drive. Won't the Saturns be better on fuel economy than the Lumina? I'm not sure I'd trust any Chevy of that age. Are these your only options? If she's small, an older Corolla will be very reliable, easy to drive and great on gas mileage. Will cost a bit more than these though because they are better cars to begin with. One Chevy that might work is the Chevy Prism -- essentially a Corolla and would be more in that price range but they are harder to find. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I am currently in the market for a new car but need help finding a sedan to suite me. I am 6'6, and I was looking at midsize SUV's, but I am not impressed with the choice out there, and am looking for gas mileage. I can fit comfortably in most sedans listed here, mainly the sonata. I was looking at getting either the Sonata or Altima based on price and what you get for it, but the main features I am looking for are sunroof, technology (hands free calling, ipod connectivity, address book integration), remote start,gas mileage, and drive. I love the new Passat, but feel it is out of my price range for all the additional features I want in a car. So im assuming I've slimmed it down to a Sonata Ltd., and an Altima 2.5s with all the features added on (speed isnt a necessity, so 6cyl/turbo arent needed.)Can anybody recommend which car is better for the money? Altima or Sonata? Also, if they have heard of Passat's being sold in that price range? Thank you very much in advance! ",Posts: 1,Member

I think an SL2 CAN be a good buy, but I certainly wouldn't get either of those without knowing exactly what is wrong.

I can't tell you why that shifter is sticking (possibly just a worn interlock, but you never know), but it could leave her stranded.my alternative suggestion is one I have given a number of times ... find a Protege.

I would get her the safest possible vehicle you could for the money and see if there's any way you can help out with the extra cost for the gas if need be. Those Saturns are not going to be nearly as safe as your minivan, just from a weight and size perspective.My daughter is 17 and 5-3, so I know what you're facing. See if you can locate a Taurus or other relatively sizeable American vehicle with plenty of airbag protection and perhaps high miles to keep the cost down, but have a mechanic look it over. (An American vehicle won't carry the price premium of an equivalent Japanese version.)Eventually, the used car market will be saturated with cars that have a good level of safety equipment. But for now, there are a lot of cars that are reliable, economical and potential death traps. When somebody loses control of his SUV or pickup, you want to make sure your daughter has as much protection around her as possible if he's heading her way. ",Posts: 50,Member

I think the answers you will get will depend on whether the poster is a Sonata or an Altima fan (or passionately hates both). They both have strengths and weaknesses. I have driven the Altima 4 cyl and really liked it, and I have several friends who have them and love them. But I'm sure Sonata folks would say the same. Your best bet is to drive each and see what you like, and read professional reviews such as Consumer Reports and the ones at Edmunds. Both should be very reliable long-term and both have lots of features and good fuel economy. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Have any of you actually owned a Korean car? I have and will not for a long while. There is a reason why they need a 100k powertrain warranty. You will be taking it in often and Kia / Hyundai dealers are nowhere near as nice as a Honda or Toyota dealers. You won't get a courtesy car and realistic resell value is much lower, especially with high mileage. Just wait till new Sonata's start hitting the market with high mileage. The 100k warranty does not transfer to the 2nd owner for a reason...., and the reality is Korean cars sell for much less then Honda's. You don't hear about Korean cars going 200,000 miles and their is a reason why. Also, repairs are often lengthy as they do not stock parts very well and in general they start falling apart after 100,000 miles. My last Korean vehicle visited the dealer 12 times in 48,000 miles before I got rid of it at a 70% loss. It was not a lemon either, just another example of the common problems that arise from cheap and poorly designed parts. ",Posts: 312,Member

Think of this from simple economics. Imagine you are the parents and you are about to purchase a car for only $2000 that's almost 15 years old with an automatic in it. What are the chances that it will die in the next year or so and cause a massive bill? The idea of a manual is to keep the car as frugal and easy to fix as possible. Reselling the car isn't a factor, either, at this level of money. You put an add on it after a year of driving it for $1500 and it's gone in 48 hours. Done. Spending $2000 an a vehicle that sees such light use and may end up costing you $2500 to fix the transmission at any time seems a bit odd to me.Add in aging AC, a radiator that's almost certainly on its last legs (DexCool - you have been warned), a worn starter, crumbling electrical components and relays... That Saturn is going to be a money pit. As are most GM cars at this age. The only exception that I can think of is one of the Toyota clones that GM re-badged. A Vibe (Matrix), for instance, is a fine choice, and as far as cheap goes, a base model Prism (Corolla).But only because you can get one that's literally got nothing on it to fail. For $2000 you need to be thinking stone-age simple and cheap as dirt to run and insure.Note - the Volvo 240 I recommended has airbags and ABS standard in 1993. It's famous for being nearly indestructible. And a lot of elderly people owned them, so finding one that's in good shape would be easy enough. Repairs are cheap and any mechanic can fix one. The Wagons are nice because she can haul stuff as well when she needs to. I owned one a few years ago and it had over 300K miles on it and still ran very well. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Over the past 11-1/2 years I've owned 3 Korean cars--all Hyundais. I still own 2 of them (2004 and 2007), and my sister still has the other one. My experience has been:* I've never needed to use the powertrain warranty--but I'm glad to have it.* All cars were very reliable. There were a few little things that needed to be taken care of, under warranty, e.g. squeaky clutch pedal on my first Hyundai, hatch struts needing replacement on my 2nd Hyundai, and a faulty power recliner on my 3rd Hyundai. But nothing major on any of them. The oldest car has over 100k on it, the 2004 has about 70k on it and still drives like new, as does the 2007 with about 55k on it. I haven't had trouble with length of repairs, my dealer has given me what I consider to be professional and courteous service (and they give me free oil changes every 3750 miles plus free shuttle service), and they have possibly the nicest dealership in the area as far as physical plant (maybe not as nice as the MB dealer next to it, but then I didn't pay MB prices for the cars). Based on KBB figures, my 2004 car is worth about 50% of what I paid for it... and it's 8 years old! And my 2007, purchased used in 2009, has dropped in value only about $1000 in over 2 years.

I have been the parent of three young adults (now in 20's and 30's). In high school two of them got automatics and were fairly old. No transmission failed. I was able to sell both cars for a decent price a couple of years later. Oldest son wanted a manual transmission. Also sold it a couple of years later -- but it took twice as long -- it's not as simple as ""slapping an ad on it"", believe me. And the two who had the automatics? Each also replaced them with auto transmission cars -- one a '99 Toyota and one a '98 Buick LeSabre. Both cars still going strong, over 140,000 miles, and no transmission trouble. As long as you get them checked out and buy a car known for reliability, auto transmissions are not a guaranteed future problem. Frugal and easy to fix were characteristics of all of these cars. The next priority should be a car she feels comfortable driving and can maneuver safely. That will vary depending upon the person. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Just wait till you try to trade in your Korean car. KBB and NADA are not realistic. Dealers use the Black Book and most of them don't want Korean vehicles. They won't give you anywhere close to what you think it is worth. You pay for what you get. Are Korean vehicles better then they were 5 - 10 years ago? Yes. Are they at the quality and reliability of Honda and Toyota? Absolutely not.The Korean dealerships here in PR are so full repairing cars that the wait time to schedule your car to get fixed averages 10 days.

I am so confused as to what to buy. I was convinced I was going to buy a brand new 2012 Elantra and now after reading another forum on here where people are posting that the gas mileage of 40mpg isn't all that accurate, I am not sure. I am buying it for the gas mileage but that is not the number one reason. I like the style of the car, the XM radio and the price is probably number 1. I also like the civic and the corolla but I felt the elantra had more room and I also want something comfortable. I think the Honda accord is as roomy but I can't afford a brand new accord.Help.... any thoughts from anyone that own one of these three cars and why they are happy with them would help me out. I am buying one of these cars easter weekend. ",Posts: 44,Member

I think you're letting a fairly minor piece of information steer your decision in a way that it shouldn't. There will always be people talking about gas mileage figures in ways that are not necessarily scientific. You can probably find similar talk about the Corolla and Civic. It's cheaper than the others to begin with, right? So don't get bent out of shape about whether it will cost you another $100 a year in gas than you expected. Buy it, be happy and don't look back.

The current issue of Popular Mechanics tested the Elantra and got well over 40MPG hwy when driven at 55MPH - the mileage dropped to below 40MPG at 70 MPH. Mileage is very driver dependent. ",Posts: 746,Member

First, the Elantra and Civic and likely the Corolla will give you better FE than a current-gen Accord. You could likely find a good used 2008+ Accord for a similar price as a new Elantra, but it won't have a factory warranty unless it's a CPO car. Of course the Accord has more room--it's rated a full-sized car by the EPA. If you want that kind of room, you should be looking at the Accord plus its competitors e.g. Altima, Camry, Fusion, Mazda6, Sonata, Optima. FWIW, you might be able to get a new Altima 2.5S or Fusion for not much more than an Elantra GLS, as the Altima and Fusion are discounted pretty heavily (they are due for a redesign very soon). Same for the 2012 Malibu, good clearance deals on those before the 2013s come in. But those are all ""mid-sized"" cars--a size up or more from the Civic, Corolla, and Elantra. If you like a lot of back-seat room, the Jetta might be the best ""compact"" in that area. But the base Jetta has an anemic 115 hp engine and the dash is pretty chintzy. Has a nice low price, however.I've driven the Elantra several times, have driven several current-gen Corollas, and have taken the 2012 Civic LX on a long test drive (5MT). IMO the Elantra is clearly the tops in that group, and the Corolla at the bottom. The Civic wasn't terrible but I like the dash of the Elantra much better than the Civic's, and the Elantra has more back seat leg room. The Corolla has a cheap interior IMO and the least back seat room of the bunch. Also I find it uncomfortable to drive. It's possible you'd get a little higher FE with the Civic, but you have to decide if that is most important to you. You might find you can get a Civic LX for less money than an Elantra GLS.Be sure you take the cars on a LONG test drive before plopping down your hard-earned money. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

This is true. I really have wanted the Elantra for almost a year now and have test driven in 4 or 5 times. I dont like the looks or style of the corolla or civic and I didn't like the style of the elantra before 2011 but now I can't get it out of my head. All these tests people have done with the mileage and trying to see if it has the 40 mpg highway is something I don't care to do when I get it. Anything will be better than what the 18 I am getting now. I keep my cars a long time (2001 for the mustang and 1995 Montero which i currently have) and I plan on trading in the mustang and keeping this car a very long time. I just want to be sure. Hyundai in the past hasn't had the name like Honda or Toyota so I guess part of me worries about the name. I know when I bought the mitsubishi back in 1995, people told me you will have problems and that Montero has been the best car I have ever had. ",Posts: 44,Member

If you want to be more sure that you'll get the fuel economy you want on an Elantra, why not rent one for a week? Rental companies like Enterprise have them. Then drive it as you normally would during the week. Sure, it will cost you a couple hundred bucks or more to rent the car for the week, but it will be worth it to make sure the Elantra is the car for you. It's not much money in the grand scheme of things, given you want to keep the car for a long time. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Forget the Civic. Honda did a bad job updating the latest Civic, so much so that Consumer Reports doesn't recommend it and Honda is going to have to revise the update as soon as it can. The previous version of the car was great to drive, but both the previous one and the current one aren't particularly great when it comes to safety ratings. I say this as a loyal Honda owner -- all three of my family's vehicles are Hondas. But the newest is a 2006. The company has been off its game the past few years. ",Posts: 50,Member

I am looking to buy a hatchback next year and the new Elantra GT hatch is on my list to consider. But it's not available until later this year.

No, same powertrain on sedan and GT but GT has an adjustable steering feel and sport-tuned suspension, also a different dash (which I like better than the sedan's), several more features/options including backup camera and panoramic sunroof (which I don't need but some people may like them), and of course the hatchback configuration with more rear headroom and cargo room, which includes a flat-folding rear seat (with a flip-up rear seat bottom). Projected FE on the GT will be very close to that of the sedan, I think I saw 1 mpg less.You might want to check out the Mazda3 Skyactiv, if you don't need a lot of rear seat legroom. It doesn't get better mpg than the Elantra but is very close, and is a blast to drive especially with the short-throw stick. All new Mazdas sold in the USA have the same warranty, AFAIK.

I am also considering the Elantra GT as an option as I want a hatchback. Also considering the Veloster as I have another 4 door car and like that the Veloster is so different (and also has the 10 year warranty). It has a more premium and solid feel than the others. Also looking at the Ford Focus which I ruled out due to the DSG troublesome tranny- Ford still has not resolved. Drove the Mazda 3 Skyactiv which I liked although, it seems cheaper inside than the Hyundai's and if you drive on hills (I live in SF) the new auto is very sluggish to downshift which helps economy but results in harder acceleration to get it to a jerky downshift. Hoping the Elantra GT comes out soon so I can at least see one. Too bad Honda has nothing interesting to offer- I have had many Hondas and Acuras. ",Posts: 58,Member

Backup camera: to avoid hitting something/someone behind you. May not be too long before they are standard in all new cars.Panoramic sun roof: think ""really big sunroof"", as in covering most of the roof. Meh.I don't know that real-world price on the Skyactiv is much more than the Elantra's. There aren't the huge discounts on the mainstream Hyundais any more, like there used to be. Since you don't need a lot of back seat room, might be worth checking out the Mazda3. Also have you driven the Focus? Back seat isn't very roomy, but has very nice blend of ride and handling, and price is helped by incentives. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Ok that makes sense. It would be interesting to see that camera in action. I know the dealership I am going through, if I get the elantra, offers a 1,200 discount to finance through them. The Gls I was looking it is 17,335 before taxes and with that discount. My 2001 ford mustang gt they are giving 7,000 in trade. I think the Mazda 3 skyactiv that I saw online was 19,245 so it might be a little more in my area. ((Utah)No I haven't driven a focus. Not quite sure I like the looks of it.

When I think of sunroof, I think ""terrarium"". The thing is, unless it opens fully, like a window (Moonroofs are a joke), it's not actually anything more than yet another windshield to look out of.

I am 5'9-1/2"" and found the leg room fine in the Mazda3 for occasional use. I wouldn't want to ride more than a couple of hours back there, but I did not feel cramped.For compact hatches, I think the cars with the most rear legroom (based on my ""sit"" tests) are the Prius (much different kind of car than the Mazda3 of course), followed by the Elantra (based on the sedan, since the Elantra GT isn't available yet), Impreza, and Golf. The Versa hatch, subcompact in length, has tons of rear legroom also--maybe the roomiest of any of these cars. But it's a class down from the Mazda3--cheaper though! Forte hatch has pretty good rear leg room also, but for the money I'd rather go with the Elantra.FWIW, the current Elantra hatch, the Touring, has limo-like rear leg room, but it's an old design and not nearly as nice and economical as the new Elantra.

Comparing MT hatches to MT hatches, the Golf (2 door) costs less than the lowest-priced Mazda3 hatch (4 door). The GTI is the top Golf trim, so you need to compare it to a comparable Mazda3s trim. And the Mazda3s does not get the same great fuel economy as the Mazda3i with Skyactiv. Also the GTI has 200 hp--topped in the Mazda3 only by the Mazdaspeed3.I recently did a sit-test in the Mazda3 and Golf within a few minutes of each other and found the Golf to have more rear-seat leg room, with the driver's seat adjusted comfortably for me (5'9-1/2"").

So here's the story, I'm about to graduate college, and will most likely be moving to Los Angeles in the next year or so to continue my education. I am looking for a new or slightly used sedan or hatch. I currently drive a 2001 camry LE, and while that thing is boring, it's also damn near indestructible. My budget is roughly 23-25k. So far, I've been considering the toyota camry, subaru impreza, hyundai elantra, etc... Most important to me are reliability and that ""fun"" factor. Right now I'm leaning towards the subaru but I don't really need AWD, although it would be nice. Give me your thoughts on these cars or suggest something better! BTW the car will MOST LIKELY be automatic, although nothing is for certain just yet. Also, I think I'll be avoiding the luxury brands for the most part due to maintenance costs and the overall image associated with them. Thanks everyone! ",Posts: 8,Member

 Well if you find your Camry boring, I have no idea why you are considering another Camry. The base impreza and the elantra aren't exactly exciting options, either. Mazda3 is not a bad suggestion.

You'll have a warranty the whole time you're in med school, so at least repair costs should be almost nothing, if anything. The Mazda3 will be nicer to you on MPG, and gas is expensive out there. I mean, it's expensive everywhere, but especially out there. Even if your parents pitch in $ for gas, that's fewer $ they have to spend on you elsewhere, if it's going into the gas tank. I think the Mazda3 hatch is a perfect choice - fun to drive, good on MPGs, not too pricey, and it's common enough (without being bland) that you shouldn't have parts/service issues anywhere. I'm not sure, but perhaps because AWD isn't necessary in LA, Subarus may be less common - they certainly have fewer dealerships overall, so if you have any recalls or work that needs to be done by a manufacturer-associated dealership, that may be an issue (might check for dealerships near the neighborhood you intend to live in).You or your parents should call up your insurance agent as well. Tell them which vehicles you're considering - there could be a VAST difference in insurance costs between various vehicles. I've found agents to be helpful there. While they might like the extra money, they really don't like a customer being shocked/angry when they find out their premiums have just gone up a lot, unexpectedly. You're going to go up anyway, in all likelihood, because the Camry probably has you pretty low, but you should know what you're looking at in case you need a ""tie breaker.""If I were your age, with your budget, I'd be driving myself insane right now trying to decide between the Mazda3 and the Elantra. I love Subarus too, but you'll have many vehicles in your future, and I'd save that for when i could enjoy the benefits of AWD. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

It sounds like you're looking for just a little bit more ""driving fun"" than the Bonneville offered you, without sacrificing space and a nice interior. I like all of the choices you mentioned, but they are going to drive differently, so a day of test-driving might be in order for you. What is your budget? That would help with other recommendations. You said teens, but are you OK with upper teens? So far, I'm not thinking of anything you've omitted that I'd be inclined to recommend... except...If you like sporty, roomy, and would consider a coupe, have you looked at the 2010 Hyundai Genesis coupe? Looks to be priced comparably to the 2010 Sonata, and has lots of metal, IMO. I have NOT been inside of one, so I can't comment on the interior room, but it's a real looker (again, IMO).The Optima is going to be the bargain of the bunch. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

I have. My Mazda3's engine threw a rod at about 72k miles. My property manager had a Mazda3 who's engine went at 20k, and then at 65k. The air conditioning on mine never really worked well.  Then again, while it was drivable it was an absolute BLAST to drive. I agree.... Mazda's reputation went into the pits when they lowered their warranty (I believe in 2005) by 25%, or from 4 years to 3 years, and equivalent ratio of loss in mileage as well. I just can't let them get away with that until they have as many red dots as Honda or Toyota. ","Posts: 12,906",Member

The Verano is a nice little car, saw it at the auto show last month. Interior is especially nice. But it will be awhile before it comes with the really good powertrain, i.e. the turbo maybe with a 6-speed stick. But starting price is in the OP's ballpark. Reliability? Hmmm... will it be up to Toyota levels? Or even Mazda levels?Could get a nicely loaded Mazda3i Touring hatch for same money as a base Verano... more fun to drive, more versatility, better economy. Not as nice an interior though. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Why not drive both and decide? There is a HUGE difference in fuel economy but only 12 hp more in the 2.5L (11 hp for PZEV e.g. CA). Also you said you probably won't get a stick, and the Skyactiv has a 6-speed auto while 2.5L has only 5 speeds. The Mazda3i Grand Touring comes pretty well equipped, including leather. Plus you get the better fuel economy. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Well, if you're new to the job-world in this economy, you need something used, fun to drive, and dirt cheap to repair.Toyota's least expensive car to repair in the last decade is... the Celica. It's the ultimate get-around town car that is fun to drive and won't break your bank keeping it running. A 2005 GTS model in near mint condition is a very affordable and good choice, as it should have at least 5-7 more years life in it. It should cost you well under $10K for a low mileage one.

Have you already test drove a Mazda3 hatch with five people in the car. If you think you're going to be driving five folks around pretty often, you might want to test drive with that many. I don't know how big you or your passengers may be, but three in the back of a Mazda3 will be pretty tight. For ~$25K you could get a Ford Fusion that's more roomy. Also, if you're concerned about MPG go for the manual transmission. ","Posts: 2,992",Member

Why not look at a VW Jetta or Golf? We bought a VW Tiguan after years of being Honda/Toyota loyalists. So far it has been more trouble free than the 09 Accord, 11 Genesis, and 11 Odyssey we recently owned. We just took it on a trip to Florida with 2 adults and 2 kids in 90 degree heat with the AC running. It averaged 28 MPG over the course of the 1200 miles we drove it. This is with the 2.0t engine and 6-speed manual transmission. The Jetta TDI would be fun to drive and gets 43 MPG+, though some of this is offset by the higher cost of diesel.

It's not really a young persons car but the RAV4s circa 2005/2006 are perfect. Extremely reliable, lots of room, very good gas mileage. Extremey low maintenance costs. In six years, not any ""repairs"", only scheduled maintenance. And a ton of room inside.Took 2 adults and 3 teens on a weekend 1000 mileage trip in the summer. We were all very comfortable during that trip. ","Posts: 5,751",Member

Also, if you're concerned about MPG go for the manual transmission. Not really an issue with the new 6 speeds in the Skyactiv. The automatic is actually rated higher in mpg by EPA than the stick.

Yeah, the main reason for the automatic transmission would be the beast that is LA traffic. Also, it would allow my family and girlfriend to drive the car, as none of them can drive stick. Problem is, I can drive stick and love it... Only time will tell. I may wait until late summer/early fall so I can scope the new (2013) mazda 3s. As for the room in the back, bobw3 you have a good point. Ill have to check that out but I'd imagine the car is decently comfortable for 4 passengers, no?

In my opinion, no. It's fun to drive, but I would never own a VW out of warranty. Though you may purchase IN warranty, that won't last too long. No VW dealers nearby definitely would kill the deal for me.At your price point, I'd consider the Optima the best value (still).

If I were going to go VW I'd go for the GTI.

The big deal with manuals in Los Angles is that they actually are not a problem at all. I live here and the thing is, that they are easier to drive than an automatic in most cases because you just drive like a truck driver. That is, instead of trying to follow at a set distance like a good little drone, you ignore gaps and just keep the thing in 2nd gear the whole time. You have to un-learn your automatic driving style and re-learn for manuals.Note that this takes a week at most. I hate shifting and during the typical Los Angeles traffic jam, my average number of shifts is well under ten in half an hour. You just have to not care and stubbornly creep and grind along letting the engine rev up and down in 2nd gear, with the occasional shift to 1st. (my vehicle drives fine in 2nd gear from about 5mph to 40mph, giving me a huge range to play with - the trick is to leave yourself enough space to slowly rev down and coast before the car in front moves and stops again. While they are going and stopping constantly, you are more like a yo-yo behind themHaving to hover over the brake because your car wants to creep forward constantly is far more annoying to me, actually, in heavy traffic. And, there is also the issue of darting into gaps and making lane changes. Automatics are pretty much a slam the pedal and pray affair, while with a manual, you're already most likely in the right gear and can simply go - no lag, no worries.What matters most in all of this is the ease of the clutch itself. Some vehicles like the Celica and the Accord/Civic are almost video game easy. Some are like a bench press. Most of this is not the clutch itself but the over-sized spring that they put on the pedal, combined with the fact that many clutches are set to engage when you're nearly at the floor. Ideally, the clutch should move 20-30 degrees. Most are set up from the factory closer to 45-60 degrees, which is very tiring. Back to car recommendations:The Lexus IS300. It's as close to that classic late 90s ""BMW"" feel that Japan ever got, IMO. It feels great. Reliability is, well, it might as well be a Corolla, since they share a lot of the same DNA. (this is a good thing, mind you) They made an is300 wagon in manual, which is a blast to drive. The automatic is also fun if it has the paddle shifters. Unlike a lot of these, this is an earlier design, so it really does stay in the gear you tell it to. Also, add a mid 2000s Mercedes C230K to the list. Note - manual only, zero options model (ie - manual seats, even, if you can find it that way). These are famous for getting 30+mpg and driving, well, like a Mercedes. Manual because you don't want a Mercedes automatic and no options because even in base trim, it's a nice car - and there's nothing to break. Note that you might be looking for a while to find one as nobody wants to sell theirs. Well, except for the 3 door coupe. These are everywhere and nobody wants theirs, apparently. Great cars, though - like a modern take on the BMW 318Ti. The first generation Rav-4 while funky looking, is a good choice as well. Get one with 4WD, though, as it allows you to do a lot more things in the mountains surrounding Los Angeles, and is actual 4WD - not all wheel drive. So you get 2WD gas mileage but when you need to go off-road, you have options. (and resale value is much better) The automatic is reliable but boring as paste. If you want new, a good option is a brand new Jeep Patriot with manual. Why? Because year-end incentives make these go out the door for close to 14K. That buys a lifetime of repairs (what with new Corollas and Civics approaching 20K?), and the factory warranty is there as well. It's a big cheap box, and perfect for just getting around in a city where your car will get dings and dents. Also, the 4WD option is quite decent off-road. I know nobody things of Los Angeles as ""off road"", but it is surrounded by a few hundred thousand square miles of mountains and deserts. Plus, it's great if you want to go skiing in the winter - AWD vehicles still require chains and mostly fail anyways. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

You probably haven't gotten an answer because no one here is familiar with what Texas offers. I will say that I do not know of any incentives offered by states to trade in a vehicle, other than the tax break offered by some states - you only pay tax on the difference between trade-in value and new car purchase price, not the whole purchase price. But I don't know about Texas.It is also a personal financial decision. A 10-year-old vehicle will eventually have issues. If you think the issues are too much to live with, you should get rid of it.

Most brakes have a lot of power brake behind them, so the effort is minimal. However, shifting to N just like in a manual risks rolling forward or backward and causing a collision if you don't have your foot on the brake anyway.As for darting into gaps with an automatic... it is not a slam and pray affair if you choose wisely. Competent Automatics will shift fairly quickly, and the best ones actually have two clutches and shift faster than the world's best race car driver could with a manual. My '03 Accord's 5-speed auto was adequately fast. My '06 A3's DSG is lightning fast. Choose your automatics wisely! ","Posts: 12,906",Member

With gas prices approaching $5/gallon again, I would not get a manual. Most modern automatics do a very good job of maximizing gas mileage; there simply is not need for a manual and the sales figures of manuals vs automatics bear this out.I drove a manual for 12 years and eventually grew tired of the 10 mile backups in heavy traffic. On the clutch, off the clutch etc.Although I have to say since I got rid of the manual the state DOT did a great job in reconstruction of the major portions of the 10 mile ride where these infamous backups used to occur. Getting through the bad stretches is not much, much easier. ","Posts: 5,751",Member

The insurance for my Honda Fit and Prius are the same. So your colleague has both the Accord and Prius of the same year and pays 70% more for the Prius?And it's a myth that you'll pay ""thousands in a few years"" for batteries in hybrids. The Prius has been in production for over 10 years and there are no reports of expensive battery replacements. Just the opposite in fact with Prius's at 150,000 to 200,000 miles on the same battery pack. And when a there is a battery issue, it's normally just one or a few cells and not the entire battery pack needing replacement. Considering the reliability of the Prius on all the various components, long-term the maintenance costs are actually lower. What if you have a VW Jetta, Malibue, or any other less reliable car for example with 150,000 miles and you're paying thousands to replace various electronic components, AC pumps, water pumps, alternators, power steering pumps, etc... Even if you did have to replace some Prius battery cells at 150,000 miles, you'd still end up with less maintenance costs than with comparable vehicles.Plus if you drove a Prius 150,000 miles at 48mpg average as compared with another sedan only averaging 28mpg at $3.75/gallon, you'd save $8,370 in gas with the Prius. Plus you'd have a more reliable car. ","Posts: 2,992",Member

Bob,  I think you make some excellent points. And when gas hits $5 a gallon (which I am sure it will in the next few years) the Prius will be even more of great commuter car. I really like the Prius and have known several folks that have owned them. I think they are a great value. That said, they are just not for me (obviously everyone has an opinion). I prefer a car with more pickup/acceleration, and less electronic/numb steering. I have been driving sporty cars and sedans the last 23 years and it is hard to adjust. But I agree with you that reliability or resale should not really be a concern with the Prius. I myself used to question longevity with the batteries and potential repair and resale, but we clearly have enough data now to know those concerns should not affect a buyer. So, for me, it just comes down to sacrificing acceleration and overall ride quality for gas savings.. I ended up meeting in the middle with a 4cyl turbo that meets my demands of acceleration and handling when I want it, but can still hit mid 30's on the highway for gas mileage on regular unleaded.

How much are you getting batteries for then? What's the replacement cost of a worn-out battery system on a Prius?

I completely agree that the Prius has no sporty flavor and is more of an appliance car.

I was more interested in space, reliability and MPG, so I choose the Prius. If 5-10 years down the road I need to spend a couple thousand on a new battery, then I'll look back at all the gas I've saved, and know that I still came out ahead. ","Posts: 2,992",Member

I am looking for a good, solidly built small car that handles well. My #1 priority, due to my medically heat sensitive son and our brutal climate, is a strong A/C - preferably one that can put a frost on you. I also want firm, supportive seats.My current car is a 2001 Jetta, which is just about perfect. Unless you consider the dreadful reliability. I decided to unload it years ago but never found anything I preferred, and now the elderly A/C is forcing my hand. Unfortunately the latest version of the Jetta is a downgrade - I'd rather move up than down.I'm not big on cars as status symbols. In fact when I had the chance to test drive a used Mercedes the hood ornament kind of bugged me. And whatever I buy now will probably be passed down to my boys when they learn to drive in 6-7 years, so there's that. I don't really need teenage boys driving a Mercedes to high school. However safety features might be good.Price? I tend to be frugal, but will also pay for quality/value. So I'm not specifying a price point; what I'm willing to pay depends on what I get for my money. I chose a Jetta over a fairly comparable Audi last time. I am apparently style blind. I actually think the Prius is a good looking car. I know, I know, but it's not fair to criticize someone who just admitted being blind. So feel free to recommend something that is butt-ugly. ",Posts: 5,Member

How about a CPO Rabbit or Golf? Solidly built, reliable (much better record than past VWs), factory warranty, and a lot of car for the money. Since you like VWs e.g. 2001 Jetta, you should like how the Rabbit/Golf ride and drive. And more practical (esp. as a school car) than a sedan. And very strong on safety--look for a Rabbit with ESC (standard on later Rabbits, and the 2010+ Golf).The Golf is arguably the highest quality compact available for a reasonable price. It hasn't been de-contented like so many other compacts have been in recent years (e.g. the new Jetta). And it isn't even ugly! Another other good choice IMO is the Mazda3i (with Skyactiv for great fuel economy). The Focus is a nice car also, good blend of ride and handling, but as a brand new design reliability is not yet proven. A used Civic is another possibility--handles better than the new ones, and a proven design. I doubt you'd like how the Corolla and Elantra handle. The new Impreza is a very nice car also, not quite as crisp handling as the Mazda3 or Golf, but you are paying extra in multiple ways for the AWD, which if you don't need it doesn't match your frugal nature.

Both inside and out.Safety: 9 airbagsI've been running the A/C when needed, it works great!Cons:Not the smoothest ride on the road, it is a little more harsh than my old car but not enough to be an annoyance (not to me anyway)...The road noise is a little more noticable than my Corolla as well, but again, to me this is not a big deal, from what I understand the lower-priced cars don't have the insulation as the higher-priced ones.

The 2001 Jetta has less rear seat room than the current Golf. I know, I owned a 2005 Jetta (last year of that design). Be sure to take your sons along if you drive one.If you like the Mazda3 but want something roomier, how about the new CX-5? Excellent fuel economy (for an SUV), Mazda-type handling, lots of utility, good room in back. Get one w/o a moonroof, for your husband. Also... if your sons find the rear of your Jetta cramped and the Mazda3 doesn't have enough headroom for your husband, don't waste time looking at the Yaris--they won't like it.

Now have newer upscale GM with outstanding A/C and also a new Sonata GLS with outstanding A/C. Point is the A/C function varies by model and maker as much as price point. More bucks do not really guarantee any function will perform if the design or application is flawed.

You know, the most overbuilt vehicles are made by GM and Ford. Ford has the edge on body construction and GM has the edge on having the most reliable transmissions.Not all domestic vehicles are toads. The Ford Edge, for instance, is actually a nice car. And given that their primary target audience is mostly people who live in the Midwest and drive long distances, rental companies, government fleets, and so on, you can guarantee that their AC and heating systems are big and over-sized.The best AC system I ever had was in a Crown Victoria. the car was also essentially indestructible. A 2-3 year old (non fleet owned - get one of the 10% that were sold to individuals) Mercury Grand Marquis might be a good option as it's cheap, will last a long time, and the lower purchase price (less tax, insurance, and registration as well) will offset the fuel difference for quite a few years. Also, these old RWD Fords are dirt cheap to fix. Literally half the cost of my previous Toyota 4Runner.20mpg vs 25mpg hardly matters if you only drive 8-10K a year and you factor in the other savings. Too many people get cars that save money up front but ride and last like the tin cans that they are. Of course, you'd expect a Civic to not be as good as a Taurus, given that one costs a whole lot more than the other and is a much larger and heavier car. Just like how a Camry is a better car than a Yaris, even used. And always will likely be until the Camry is literally ready for the junk yard.Another good car to look at for the same reason would be any of the larger Buick or Cadillac sedans. Since most have a V6 in them they get good MPG and are built to soak up day after day of highway miles. A couple of year used Lucerne/Park Avenue/LaCrosse/etc with the V6 would be good if fuel is a concern, or you could get a couple of year used DTS or V8 Lucerne if you don't drive much. Only get the non-supercharged 3.8/3.9 models though. These are more reliable and have less to go wrong with them. Case in point, my mother's Buick LeSabre is ugly as a toad but it's turning out to be dirt cheap to keep running and a good commuter car. With a few basic hypermilling techniques on the highway, it can just barely eek out 30mpg on long trips. That's quite impressive. And it has a whole slew of options that most budget cars don't have like HUD, digital displays and diagnostic systems, leather, premium sound... These don't suck by any means, no matter what the auto magazines say if you are coming from a budget set of wheels.All will be fantastic for a kid's first car as they are bigger and safer. They don't like to be driven fast and that's good for your wallet and blood pressure. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hello,I am a new grad (23 years old) living in Alberta, Canada and I would like some help purchasing my very first new car. What I'm looking in a car is safety, reliability, affordability, fuel efficient and decent room/comfort when driving.I was looking at the 2012 Corolla vs. the 2012 Elantra. The Corolla is slightly less expensive than the Elantra but from the reviews I've been reading the Elantra seems to get significantly better ratings than the Corolla. I'm also wondering if the sudden acceleration problem that Toyota was having a couple years back is fixed yet? I've read the 2012 Lemon-aid book and drivers are still reporting issues with the acceleration/steering (Elantra got 5 stars while Corolla only got 2). Any other car suggestions would be greatly appreciated.My budget is around $20k...if I save a few more months I should have enough to pay my car in cash and not need financing. Also, another thing I'm debating is that...should I go for a compact or mid-sized sedan(I will need financing then)? Thinking for the future, I'll probably have kids and maybe a mid-sized sedan would be more suiltable?Thank you for your time and help. ",Posts: 1,Member

I was looking for the same things as you when replacing my 2001 Corolla LE a few months ago - I got a 2012 Toyota Yaris LE - it's a subcompact liftback (not compact) and so far I love it - this is my 3rd liftback...I've already submitted a couple of reviews so at the risk of a lengthy re-peat let me just say that the gas mileage is better than expected (36.5 mpg), it's safety factor received high marks from ""expert"" reviewers; has 9 airbags, comfortable driver's seat, good visibility, easy to handle/park, comes with 2 yrs/25K free scheduled maintenance from Toyota, Vehix has it on their list as one of 2012's most reliable cars...Toyota re-designed it and (to me) it is an attractive car - it feels very roomy on the inside too - not cramped - I will say however that the ride is not as smooth as my Corolla and the engine is not as quiet, but for me this is not a big deal - the lower-priced cars don't have the insulation as their higher-priced counterparts (as least that's my understanding).In the months leading up to my purchase (in the beginning anyway) I was planning to get another Corolla because it was such a good car, but after test-driving a Yaris last year (2011 model) I realized that it was more in line with what I wanted, and after seeing a picture of the 2012 model I waited until they starting arriving at the dealership so I could check it out - I got it for less than $17,700 OTD, this is including all taxes, fees, etc.Hope this helps.

If you really will need a mid-sized car soon and $20k is comfortable for you, you can get a very nice new mid-sized car for $20k now, especially since some mid-sizers are being replaced soon. Some options in that range include the Altima 2.5S, Fusion S or SE, 2012 Malibu LT, and Mazda6i Sport. You can also probably find a Sonata GLS or Optima LX under $20k including T&L with some shopping. And with the Accord being redesigned soon, you might be able to find an Accord LX under $20k. You could find that one of these mid-sizers is not much more than an Elantra GLS with preferred package, since the Elantra doesn't have the same level of discounting as these mid-sizers.

Keep in mind that the Elantra is a recent redesign, while the Corolla is not only an old design, but is due to be redesigned for the 2013 model year. Some people don't like buying a car only to have the new version come out just after, so I thought I'd point that out. ","Posts: 2,743",Member

I mulled it over a bit today while I was fixing a tree root that was growing into the side of the house (sigh) - and if you like Japanese reliability and want a German feeling driving experience, the best option is to get a used Lexus IS300. IMO, it's as close as they ever got to reaching a BMW feel in their cars, and it's just a great thing to drive. The IS250 is heavier and less powerful and feels more like a fancy Civic/Corolla/etc, and the IS300 is simply too much muscle-car. It looses that magic weight balance and agile feel that the IS300 had. Test drive one. You'll probably end up driving it home  ","Posts: 3,738",Member

2005 was the last year for it, and it's not perfect. BUT, they did make a wagon version of it, which takes care of the rear headroom issue. The deal about this generation Toyota, though, is that it will last to 15 years or so without major issues. And honestly, the kids can DEAL with the rear seat. All rear seats suck unless you're buying something like a Buick or other huge car. A VW or BMW or Mercedes, while incredible to drive, will bankrupt your child when it comes to driving it at college. Going on 8-10 years old, it'll be right at that OMG what broke this week stage. But my real suggestion is to gt what you want. And get another car at the time. The perfect car would be a used Honda Fit or something that can carry cargo and is dirt cheap to drive while in school. Or even something older like a Tacoma pickup. Let it get beat up, dented, and used. And hardly pay a dime to keep it running. Then sell it and let them get their own vehicle. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Yes, any several year old AC will likely need to have parts replaced or attended to at the least. But you can factor that into the price of the vehicle when you buy it. Then it should be good for several years.The cars are good for 250-300K, so getting one that has 40-60K on it is really not an issue at all. Just beware that a lot of them were abused or driven hard, so look for signs of heavy wear, non-factory parts or mods (or repairs) and go on to the next one. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

If you are thinking about buying a 2011 or 12 Malibu buy the six. I have a 2011 with the 4 and normally drive to Dallas on 4 lane highways. I took the car to Albuquerque on two lane roads and had to pass several trucks. The car doesn't always downshift when floored and it is woefully underpowered for passing at 50-70. If I had made the trip before I had bought it I would have never purchased it with a four. My Cobalt has more passing power with the 4 speed automatic. The gas mileage is not anything to write home about - 29-33 mostly on the road. My 03 Cadillac DeVille made 30-31. Other than the lack of power for passing the Malibu is fine. Rides ok, needs more insulation from road noise but for the price is fine. If I had to do it over again I would have bought a used Buick Lucerne or LaCrosse but I'll go back to a Cadillac in the next few years. ",Posts: 299,Member

I'm a first time car buyer (previously drove a car I inherited for 10 years til it died.) I'm new to this forum and wanted people's opinions (and realize car ownership can be VERY subjective.) I'm hoping to hold on the car for a long time (I just drive for pleasure and usually only do about 3000 miles a year, but most of it is on highways.) Am looking to spend roughly $20,000.I'm considering 3 cars (all with automatic transmission):1) Subaru Impreza hatchback2)the new Hyundai Elantra GT3) Volkswagen Golf (4 door)Am planning to buy in the spring, but am just starting my research and am planning on doing test drives for all three--and, if possible, renting them to really check them out.Aside from the obvious pluses for each (AWD for the Subaru, great warranty for the Hyundai) I'd love opinions from folks as to which car (out of the 3) they prefer and why.Many thanks in advance!

First, unless you get much snow, I'd move the Impreza lower on your list as it will cost more and exacts a bit of an mpg penalty for AWD. But I think it's a very nice car... I live in Minnesota though.I think the Elantra GT is very nice also, but for $20k you'll be looking at a base model with AT and that's it. Doesn't look like Hyundai plans to ship many of these over here, so prices will probably stay up even next spring. BTW, similar problem with availability on the Impreza... hard to find any selection in stock.Re the Golf... keep in mind the Golf VII will be here sometime next year, so if you buy a Golf VI in the spring, it will be a generation old overnight. So you could wait for the Golf VII, which is supposed to have a turbo engine standard and better FE, or... you could get a slightly used, VW Certified Golf VI. You could get a very nice one including an extended warranty for $20k. Based on your looking at these cars, two others I think are worth a look for you are the Mazda3i Touring hatch (Skyactiv), which is a blast to drive, and the Focus hatch, also fun to drive albeit I'd stay away from the auto on that one, but reportedly Ford has worked out the kinks on it, or most of them at least.

Why not? If a redesign will get much better fuel economy than the old design, for example, that is a big benefit for long-term ownership. That is certainly the case for the current crop of compacts--the latest redesigns tend to get much better FE than the old ones, and sometimes with more power to boot. There's also the safety factor--the newer the design, the more active and passive safety features tend to be included. For example, the latest Elantra design, the GT, has 7 airbags, and the current gen entire Elantra line has ESC standard--that was not the case with the prior design. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Nor safety either I suppose?3k miles a year for 10 years is 30k miles. At 25 mpg, that's 1200 gallons. At 30 mpg, it's only 1000 gallons.

You are in an area known for high auto insurance rates, so I suggest you run a few models past your independent insurance agent. It is likely that one model could save you more in insurance cost than in fuel economy, considering that you estimate a low 3K per year (what I drive in 6 weeks).I would not eliminate the Impreza so quickly. The AWD has advantages in rain and you never know when the weather will change if you travel. Also the flat 4 cylinder engine design has a lower center of gravity. My subarus have had low insurance costs relative to some other cars in my fleet. In contrast, Hyundais often have high insurance costs. The only current generation Golf I would consider would be a TDI, but that's 20-25% over your budget. I second the suggestion to look at a Mazda 3i SkyActive. In fact, that should probably be near the top of your list. ",Posts: 399,Member

And you may pay $800 or more for the newer model year. Which is why I said ""all else being equal.""Sure, if you have to pay more for the later design and its advantages aren't worth the extra money, get the old design. Even get a used car, as I suggested. For 3k miles a year, it really doesn't make sense to buy a new car. Let someone else take the big up-front depreciation. The only reason to buy new in that case is... to get the latest design. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I agree about the visibility. There are some moves - such as merging to the right into the fast lane from a left hand entrance ramp, that can be white-knuckle experiences in some vehicles. I always enjoyed the visibility of my subarus with their large ""old-fashioned"" rear windows. But when my beloved 09 Outback was totalled when a young driver slammed into me at 60-65 mph while I was stopped at a red light, I found a less expensive (smaller) model with visibility as good or better - a Suzuki SX-4. Not only is the visibility good when glancing over the shoulder, but the mirrors seem to be a perfect shape. And best of all, the car is a bargain. Last time I looked, www.fitzmall.com showed a new 2012 equipped like my 2011 for as low as15.2K with 0% for 72 months (an auto trans + a few options and you'd still be under 17K).

You really need to get a CPO or slightly used car. The economy is tight, and it's simply bad economics to not let someone else eat the initial 40-50% depreciation. To make the point, for $20K, you can get a 3-4 year old Cadillac CTS. Or a 3-4 year old C class. Let alone a used Accord for $15K, or my favorite, older GM cars for 12K. Sometimes two years old.You drive so little that you really should get a larger mid to full size upper-end car if you can. After all, a used Camry is always going to be a better car than a brand new Yaris. Not only in safety and features, but also reliability, as everything is just built better. CPO is of course, preferred, as you get a warranty and some peace of mind. If you absolutely have to have a new car, there is one that is a great deal, is $20K , and gets great MPG. The new Ford Mustang. It drives great, gets 30mpg highway, and with year-end incentives (wait 8-9 weeks), 20K for a base model is quite easy to accomplish. Note - I went to Cars Direct and selected:- 2013, a normal color (dark blue looks great)- the option package with the fog lights, poser seats, and tech upgrades- limited slip diff.(did not select the 19"" tires as it just makes the car ride like a rock)$23,837 including a $795 delivery charge. By the end of the year, $20K will easily be possible with some haggling. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Thanks for all the tips, you guys! And plekto, I actually don't like sedans. I want a hatchback. CPOs for the hatch's I'm looking at aren't super low/worth having less time on the warranty. I actually had a long conversation last night with my cousin who's owned a Subaru for 16 years and it's still going strong. She was raving about it (as did my neighbor who has the Impreza.) The Impreza is starting to look like a front-runner for me (love the idea of AWD--while I don't drive in the snow that often, things might change in a few years--I have a small cottage in the woods and it's completely inaccessible in the winter without either AWD or 4WD.)

Hard to predict cost of ownership differences between the two, given that they're both Lexus products and fairly similar in underlying mechanics. The IS is essentially a trimmed-down GS. I'd dig pretty deep through consumer discussions on these two vehicles and see if there's anything that influences your decision one way or the other. A quick look on Edmunds shows a lot of unhappy IS owners in recent reports compared to GS owners, but that make be a fluke.Seems to me that the IS is kind of a fake BMW 3-series, in that it doesn't have much of a sporty character despite its packaging. In the long run, I would guess that would hurt its resale value more than the GS, which doesn't pretend to be anything but a luxury car. ",Posts: 50,Member

I'd actually look at other cars, because if you are looking at something used, you'll be wanting to find something that suffers as much depreciation as possible so that the first owner eats most of the car' value. It's a bit mercenary to view it this way, but it's just how it works in finance.Lexus depreciates too slowly at first - mostly driven by dealer greed. But once they get to about 6-7 years old, the value drops sharply.(CPO isn't an option that old, so everything is priced off of base/auction price, pretty much)I'd personally recommend something from Mercedes if you want luxury, or something like a 2008 CTS. You can get a better quality car a couple of years newer for about the same money. Also, the Cadillac is significantly more sporty than the Lexus, and better equipped as well. (it should be, considering what it originally cost). ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Danger! Danger! The combination of not knowing anything about cars and trying to find one priced between $1,000 and $3,000 is one that can lead to some serious regret later on. The Eclipse may be fine, but it may need a lot more than paint -- and you can't tell unless you've had a mechanic do a thorough inspection. So if you pay $2,000 and face $3,000 in repairs, you're suddenly way beyond your budget. The Integra and Paseo I would guess to be more reliable than the Sunbird or Eclipse, but none of these are guaranteed to be anything close to trouble-free when they're all obviously old and at the end of their lives. More important than the car is the seller in your case. If you can find someone who is honest and straightforward and can give you a good idea of what might need fixing soon and what has been replaced, buy it. Otherwise, keep looking. Probably a private seller who is a friend or family member is your best bet. Good luck! ",Posts: 50,Member

The new Impreza is much improved for fuel economy vs the old ones. So I'd eliminate that as a reason to skip it.Surprised no one has mentioned the Honda Fit? You can get a very nice one for your price and have both a fun car and one with a lot of carrying capacity thanks to the clever way its seats fold down in the back. ",Posts: 50,Member

You're basically going to be looking at big boats. IE - a Buick LeSabre/Park Avenue or a Crown Vic. Find something that was NOT used for a fleet or rental and you should be fine. $3K should get you something that is fairly reliable.Anything else will be a complete money pit or be a total DIY project.

 I understand that, that is why i am taking my uncle, he is a great mechanic, he will go with me, turn on the car, test drive, check the engine, i am a smart shopper i think, If i see its just a young punk, i know the car has been through hell, that is why, when i look for old cars, I try to make sure the seller, is honest and a age adequate to the car, I also like the Mirage from 95 to 2000, but mostly they are own by young kids wanting to BRROOOM BRROOM all day and sell the car cause they broke it enough hahaha, But can you recommend any other car? Like I said, aslong as it as the look of a Integra, RX7 or Eclipse(1990), I will try it, i've loved those box design cause they look good and respectable ",Posts: 2,Member

The problem with those cars is that they age very poorly. The RX7 is a nightmare to maintain once it gets past 10 years old or so (which they all are approaching *twice* that age), the Integra of that age is basically a fancy Civic, and overpriced versus, say, a used newer Civic, Mirages in that price range are all generally falling apart or close to it (good cars but poor interiors as a rule), and an Eclipse that old is... you might as well just buy a used 280ZX and fix it up.What you want is something that is seen as a old person's car, depreciates like a rock, and is built to actually still be running in the 15 year old range or so. Like I said, this means something either so simple you can work onit yourself, or something that was overbuilt and is a big tank. You can actually get perfectly good working 2002 Crown Vics for $3K. You can get a ~2000 Buick LeSabre for about that price. It'll likely have been owned by an elderly person who didn't abuse it. Note - my mom's 2000 LeSabre will go 80mph quite easily - it's deceptively quick. 27mpg highway is also a nice bonus.If you want sporty and old, here are a few to consider:- 1993 Volvo 240. This was the last year and they are extremely reliable and simple to keep running. They handle quite well for their age. Also consider a 940, which is a 240 with a better exterior and fancier options. Get with manual.- 4 cylinder Toyota Rav4/Tacoma/4Runner with manual. This is indestructible and works. Volvos and Toyotas are well known to last 300K+ miles. Avoid 6 cylinder models. Avoid automatics. - BMW 318Ti. This is a specific BMW that is cheap to run and actually is quite reliable. Because it's a hatchback, it was panned by Americans (much like the Mercedes C230K hatchback was). This means very low prices. Upkeep is more than the other options, but it's worth it in the end. Manual, naturally. Drives like, well, a BMW.On manuals - manuals make you a better, more in-tune driver, and they cost a few *hundred* to put a new clutch in.(or $150 if you DIY) Automatics on ancient cars run $1500-$2000, typically. GM's big cars (Buick and Cadillac) and the Crown Vic are notable overbuilt automatics that I'd recommend 10 years old. BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo were almost entirely sold with manuals in Europe. It's the only way to but a European car, IMO. As little to break as humanly possible, and a manual gearbox.Other than that, get a classic car for $2500 and work on restoring it. If you get something with carbs and pre-smog, as well as pre-computers, you can actually keep it running for a very long time with elbow grease. Your uncle will likely like this option, actually, as he can help you fix things quite easily compared to modern 15-20 year old cars which are usually a mess of crumbling wiring and aging computers and sensors. But my first choice of all of those above? Get a used 4Runner. You can save a lot, btw, if the thing has a few places with rock rash and dings, which a lot of them have. 4WD, of course. Look for a Marlin Crawler transmission and/or transfer case if it has one fitted to it. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi All,I had written about a month ago asking opinions on buying a new car.Well, I've narrowed it down to two choices now:1) The Subaru Impreza 5 door Premium2) VW Gold 5 door base model with Convenience package (which adds bluetooth, etc.)I've been renting a bunch of cars (sadly neither one of those models yet) and have realized a couple of things. My old car had a v6 engine and while the hp was 134, the torque was 180. I've been finding that I'm not crazy about cars with lower hp/power. Also, my old car had pretty tight steering, which I prefer. That puts a bit of an edge on the Golf for me. So before I head off to test drive these my main questions are:Which car is more expensive to maintain after the warranty? Which car lasts longer all things being equal? (I take REALLY good car of my cars, keep them garaged, keep up with maintenance and do about 3000 miles a year.)Thanks again all. ",Posts: 11,Member

Given you drive 3k miles a year and you take REALLY good care of your cars, keep them garaged etc., I don't think you need to worry about longevity in either of these cars.One thing to consider is re the CVT on the Impreza, if you are going that route. I am not 100% sold yet on CVT reliability, although I drive a car with a CVT today (2010 Sentra)--but it has a 10 year, 120k mile warranty on the CVT. If I were deciding between these two cars (and they are both on my shopping list for next year, albeit I hope the Golf VII is out by then), I'd definitely go with the stick on the Golf. It's a great shifter, has a tall 5th gear for low revs on the highway (less noise, better FE), and will likely hold up better in the long run than the automatic. And it's more fun.  For the Impreza, I would tend to go with the CVT based on driving both the 5-speed and CVT and finding the CVT to be much quieter, lower revving, and having better FE.And of course the Golf has much more torque than the Impreza--also likely lower FE, esp. compared to the CVT Impreza. But considering you drive 250 miles a month, the difference in FE on these two cars is moot. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

it appears as though Nissan is sticking with the CVT. I drove a Versa hatchback the other day and was blown away by the CVT. I can't wait to buy a used one.

Yeah, we all know how much those Bimmers and Benzes suck! Who'd want to drive one of those piles of crap! We'd all rather drive a Renault-inspired econobox that starts falling apart after a couple of years. :P Actually the Golf (and Rabbit before it) has an excellent predicted reliability record, per CR. The Impreza is a new design, but earlier Imprezas had an excellent record. Significant difference there? I don't see it. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The trick with BMW and Mercedes is to only get manual and to get specific base models with no options (like sunroofs and nav systems) to break. Volvo is kind of the same as well. Keep it simple and it's fine. The issue is that you can hardly get the base trim and manual any more in most European brands. VW is one of them, though, and they are fine if you get a basic car with the basic engine.But for a first time buyer, sporty and fun and all the things a young driver lusts after are not going to happen for $3K. Not unless you go into a classic car and start restoring it. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Thanks, Backy. I actually spoke with my mechanic this morning and he suggested the Subaru (based on repair costs--he said the Golf is super-expensive to repair and the Subaru is more reliable.) But, given that, I'm now starting to look at one of your original recommendations--the Mazda3 hatch. I was originally concerned about the Mazda's visibility, but think I'll take it for a spin to see. Only reason I'm not 100% sold on the Subaru is the hp/torque. I do most of my driving on the highway and then hills. I've found a lot of the rentals I've been trying really struggle on hills if they have lower hp/torque. I guess I just have to test drive the Subie (luckily, there's a rental car place around here that has the Golf & Mazda--and they rent by the hour--so I can try those on hills & highway.) BTW--I don't drive a stick, so have to stick with an automatic. I ",Posts: 11,Member

VWs might be expensive to repair, but consider... how many repairs will a Golf that is driven 30k miles in 10 years and is maintained exceptionally well need? Not many I'd wager.For your driving habits, I strongly recommend you get the car you like driving best, first and foremost. All other factors, including FE and reliability, are of lesser importance for the few miles you drive. That being said, I think you'll like how the Mazda3 drives. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I hate CVTs with a passion and the Impreza is no exception! I also drove one with manual and I liked it much better. But the Golf 5-door is better in the areas that are most important to me!The Golf has significantly more hp and torque and it is obvious, especially under light to modereate throttle. The Golf's standard 6AT is one of the best I've sampled in a while. It is usually in the gear that it needs to be in and doesn't balk at part-throttle kick-downs for instant power when you need it. The inteiror materials look and feel very high quality and they are assembled perfectly. They would not look out of place in an Audi A3.The car feels as solid as a bank vault on the road. It feels like it will stay tight for many miles into the future.The only issue I have with the Golf is that it comes with 15"" steel wheels and fugly plastic wheel covers! But that can corrected in a few ways- VW will sell you a slick set of 17"" wheels for $1500 or so. Or you can go aftermarket and spend well under $1k, but still change the whole look of the car! One more quick detail about the Golf- it is available in six colors, most of them are nothing special but one really stood out and looked awesome- Blue Graphite! With a sharp set of silver alloys, it would look more like a $30k car.Final note- I'm being totally serious- this is the first time I've recommened a VW in over 10 years on this and other auto sites. I would normally give the top nod to the Mazda3, but it's not quite as special as it used to be....btw, the Golf has very good reliability ratings on CR! ",Posts: 801,Member

Well, you obviously get a manual with either of these cars.Another car to consider would be the Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S (joint venture between the two companies) I like the FR-S a bit better as it has a much lower actual/street price and is a little quicker with the manual. But 25K might be out of your budget.Lastly, there is my personal budget economy car. But you're going to probably think I'm joking...Wait a month. Get a 2012 Mustang with the V6 engine. It gets 30mpg (real world) highway and has no issues at all with power. The insane part of it is the price - $20K. And that's now. Not in a month when they add another 2K in incentives, most likely, you'll be able to haggle 18K for a base model. The upgraded looks of the 2013 are better, but they also make the 2012 less desirable. In a month, dealers will be begging you to take one, especially if it's manual.The price of it has hardly changed while the imports are charging huge amounts for their economy cars. You can hit 25K on a Golf without blinking.(all manual here - there's ZERO reason to buy automatics that make it slower than a slug) 0-60 in 10+ seconds (real-world driving without dropping it into gear at full throttle) isn't sporty or fun. Having to flog it to get up a mountain pass isn't either. I remember trying to get onto a freeway uphill with a little 4 cylinder with the power to weight ratio of the Impreza and I almost wet myself every time I tried to do it. 60mph uphill was closer to 20 seconds due to there being so little torque for the huge weight (these all weigh way over 3000lbs). Add a passenger and you pretty much were looking for a 200ft+ gap. VW Golf 23/33 (26 combined) 170HP/177 TorqueMustang V6 19/29 (23 combined) 305 HP/280 Torque (0-60 5.8)Mazda 3 20/28 (23 combined) 150 HP/134 TorqueImpreza 25/34 (28 combined) 148 HP/145 TorqueBRZ/FR-S 22/30 (25 combined) ~200 HP/~150 TorqueTo me, the Mustang stands out as a fun, fast, and inexpensive option. And it looks great as well. You can also somewhat stomach the automatic, IMO, if you have to, as it has more than enough power to deal with the losses and lag. Fords are also cheap to repair.

""Well, you obviously get a manual with either of these cars.""The 2012 VW Golf 2.5L 4-door is only available with a 6-speed automatic transmission, manual not available. The 2-door 2.5L has a standard 5MT and the 6AT is optional. The only 4-door Golf with a manual is the TDI with a standard 6MT. I was surprised that to see that the 2012 Impreza only has a 5-speed manual when almost every competitor offers a 6-speed manual instead. I would think that extra ratio would be very useful in offsetting the new car's less powerful 2.0L engine, but I guess the 5MT won't run off the Subaru faithful. ",Posts: 801,Member

THank you both for chiming in! I really like hatchbacks, so the Mustang's out-and I know Mustangs are fun to drive--my ex used to have one. Re: the Golf--this was my first choice initially--everyone I know who's driven one says they walk away with a smile on their face. It's just a fun solid drive. The only thing that made me even think about a different car was the repair/maintenance costs on the Golf. I've heard from 2 mechanics and a friend who said the parts AND labor are typically waaaayyy more pricey than they are for Subarus--both mechanics advised me to go with the Subaru. I take really good care of cars, but learned the hard way with my old one that even if you keep up with maintenance and garage a car, age can creep up--especially if you don't drive it all the time (which I don't--it's better to drive a car on a regular basis vs once a week--or less in winter.) So I'm concerned about having to spend a bundle down the line (I live in NYC so everything here is really expensive to begin with!)I sat in my neighbor's Outback and thought the seats felt cheap and I know that's an issue with the Impreza and just like you said, I have heard the Golf feels like a real premium ride on the inside. BTW, I don't drive a stick so automatics are my only option. If anyone here has experience to the contrary re: maintainence/repair for the Golf, I'd love to hear it cause that will definitely impact on my decision. Thanks again! ",Posts: 11,Member

Normally I'd agree, get a manual with either car, but after driving the 5-speed and CVT on the Impreza, I know I would not be happy with the 5-speed. I found it to be considerably noisier than the CVT, higher revving, and that will translate to lower mpg. They seemed like two different cars. The CVT seemed more refined, the 5-speed like an econobox. This is one reason the Impreza is relatively low on my shopping list for next year, vs. cars with sweet manual trannies e.g. Golf and Mazda3. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The handling package on the Mustang transforms the car into close to a CTS competitor. But truthfully, if you DO get a Golf/GTI, you're missing out on possibly one of the best cars *to* learn manual on. The automatic makes the car frankly feel like a basic econobox with slightly better handling - it just kills the feel and direct connection to the road that you get in a VW. And VW's automatics aren't exactly known for their reliability. Their manuals are fine, though. And a LOT cheaper to fix if they do break. ( 6-800 vs 3-4K)A Impreza, though, is terrible with the CVT. Just simply appalling. http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-subaru-impreza-20-cvt-hatchback-test-re- views""Trading performance for EPA-rated efficiency""Absolutely get the manual. Subarus with manuals are also fantastic. Well, the 2012 was. Don't touch the 2013, which is 9 seconds 0-60 with the CVT - and that's dropping it into drive with the engine at redline. Expect 12 with a normal mash the pedal from a stop and letting it do what it wants. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

She can learn manual in a couple of hours (any old car or truck will do). It amazes me how people wanting sports and performance on a budget are unwilling to actually learn how to drive a manual these days. It's just criminal to take cars like these, which keep getting heavier and heavier, and that have small engines, and then hamstringing them even further with a CVT or automatic.Quite honestly, the CVT in the new de-powered Impreza feels like driving a 1990s Volvo 240. It has this spongy ""I'll get to it when I want to"" feel in the drive-train. Handling is great, but it's slow and lacks the power to actually push the limits given its bulk. As a result, it trundles down the road and you feel that excitement is always just out of reach. 148HP and ~2900lbs. That's worse than a early 90s Buick in terms of power to weight ratio. We're actually going backwards as of late in order to make MPG freaks happy.Now, the Mazda is quite a nice car, but with the automatic, it might as well be a Corolla or Civic. A basic box and not much else. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that sort of vanilla experience is what you are looking for. FYI, if I was to buy a basic commuter box like that, Mazda does, IMO, make a better ""Civic"" than Honda does.To get the same sporty experience that you typically get with a manual in a small car, you need to typically get a 6 cylinder engine with the automatic. But that adds a lot of cost and weight, and very few small cars have larger engines in them these days aside from maybe a used BMW. If anything, there's a move towards smaller engines as of late.

I'm guessing you would take exception to someone suggesting a string of slushboxes to you when you state you desire a manual car, am I right? I know I'm right. :shades: Anyway, back to topic, of the automatic equipped hatch options out there, the Mazda3 should be at the top of the list. The Ford Focus is also worth a look, got a lot more techie-stuff in it than the Mazda, in exchange for slightly lower FE, and a less sporty ""automatic"" option (it's actually a DCT, but in manual mode it still retains a mind of it's own, unlike the Mazda automatic transmission). One could also check out the Kia Soul or Hyundai Elantra GT, but I don't particularly care for either one, on a scale from Buick to BMW they definitely lean Buick. The Veloster Turbo might be worth a look, lots of power, 6 speed automatic, fairly decent FE for the power, but the automatic retains a mind of its own in manual mode, and I hear the steering and suspension are a bit lifeless.

The Mazda 3 is.. well, let's just say it is nothing in the world like the RX8 was. It's a very *nice* car, but it's honestly a box to get around in. Nothing more. The automatic is just there (neither good or bad), much like now it is in a Honda, a Chevy, or any other number of basic cars.But having a manual does without a doubt make for a better experience in mountain roads and zipping in and out of traffic. Absolutely no question about it. And they are much less money to fix.I personally don't like most automatics, but some cars like a Cadillac CTS and the G37 (as examples) drive just fine with them. But certainly nothing with less than about 200lb-ft of torque. With cars approaching 3500lbs as a ""normal"" weight, and virtually nothing aside from a Yaris that's under 2900-3000, there's just too much dead weight to move around for a small engine to be enjoyable or remotely approach anything that would be considered fun or sporty. It's like we're in 1983 again with cars that are just simply too heavy for their engines. IMO, the magic car for her might be a 2011 RX8. Driving it in manu-matic mode with the paddles actually is quite fun. The car is quick and handles great. In fact, it's within a couple of percent in testing versus a base Porsche Boxster. (0.1 second 0-60, a fraction of a mph in the slalom, and so on). It's about the least expensive sports car out there that I know of. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Thanks, all.

I can, at least, rent a Mazda 3 and give it a whirl--an idea I like way better than doing a test drive.

It's somewhat insulting to tell a shopper that the vehicles they're considering aren't ""decent,"" and that they basically have to exceed the budget that they have available or have consciously decided to spend on a vehicle, in order to get a vehicle that meets YOUR desires, not theirs.

THanks all! I wasn't insulted by it, btw. It just wasn't very useful info. Re: the Versa. I actually rented one a couple of weeks ago and LOVED LOVED LOVED the steering (and visibility.) What I didn't like was, the power. It felt like it was really *pushing* just to go up small inclines. But aside from that, it was a pleasure to drive. Truthfully, if I can find a car that has that type of steering and visibility with a bit more power, I'm good (aside from safety, etc.) I'm interested to see how they update the Versa. And not for nothing, a good friend owns one (just bought it a year ago) and she and her hubby love it. ",Posts: 11,Member

Nissans are pretty nice, I just can't forgive them for not making a Sentra hatch. :shades: You know, I don't know if premium gasoline turns you off, but the Juke might be worth checking out also. AWD, turbo engine, it's on the heavy side for such a small vehicle but it's very peppy and can be lots of fun, particularly when using the manual shift mode to keep the engine on boil. And AWD gives tons of grip (they never send us non-AWD versions up here in the Northeast). Hey, if you'll be at a Nissan dealer anyway, worth looking, right? ","Posts: 2,743",Member

Thanks for that update on your impressions on the Versa hatchback. For a hard plastic, assembled in Mexico (with no Renault parts to my knowledge) economy car, I was amazed at the ride. The steering, brakes and visibility are all A+ I also like the fact that one can find an SL with the premium package that will put the phone buttons on the steering wheel, all without breaking the bank. When I checked out the engine, I did not quite reconcile how I would take the oil filter out. My hands could just get around the filter from the top of the engine. If from the bottom, I believe I would have to remove the plastic apron to get access. If so, that would be a bummer. ","Posts: 1,340",Member

The problem is that the person in question wants something new, a hatchback, automatic, and inexpensive. That also is sporty and handles well.That segment exists in the U.K. (""hot hatch"") but is just not available in the U.S. currently. If she is willing to entertain sedans, then it's a whole other ball game. I've personally never bought a car new - I always get it a few years old and let the original owner eat the depreciation. I also get a car that is a couple of steps up from the same price econobox, with more features, more safety, and an overall better driving experience. 15-20K buys you a very very nice used or CPO car these days.Note - there IS a used car that would be perfect for her in every way. Go check out a Lexus IS300 Sport Cross. It's as close to a Japanese version of a late 90s BMW or Mercedes wagon as you'll ever find. They made these from 2001- 2005 and it's fantastic. And reliable. I personally consider it to be more of a hatchback than a wagon, since it's really just the sedan with a somewhat squared off rear end.It reminded me (the IS300 as well), of driving a E36. Very solid, very sporty, and very ""European"" in how it felt like an extension of your body. The model that came after it lost all of that sport sedan magic, somehow. It felt like a Toyota again (and still does)You should be able to get a low mileage one owner example for 12-15K. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Re: the Versa. I actually rented one a couple of weeks ago and LOVED LOVED LOVED the steering (and visibility.) What I didn't like was, the power. It felt like it was really *pushing* just to go up small inclines. The Versa hatch comes with two different auto trannies depending on the trim level. The base 4 speed auto is a dog, and that's the one most rental companies carry. The uplevel SL comes with the CVT; it definitely has more pick up. Whether you like the CVT is entirely subjective, but its worth a look. ","Posts: 3,007",Member

How can ANY used car be ""perfect in every way"" when someone is looking for a NEW car?!Re no inexpensive hatches available with automatics that are sporty and handle well... a lot of this is subjective, but with the average price of a new car in the USA about $31,000, a new car for around $20k could be considered ""inexpensive"". And if so, I think there's at least 3 if not 4-5 cars that qualify, ranked in my personal order based on ""sportiness"":1) Mazda32) Golf3) Focus4) Elantra GT5) ImprezaI intentionally didn't add the Veloster because it appears the OP is looking for a 4-door hatch.""Sporty"" doesn't necessarily mean fast. None of these cars is particularly fast/quick, especially with an automatic. But they can be fun to drive, especially the top 3. The automatic will sap some fun-to-drive out of all of them, but it's a firm requirement here so that's the way it is. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Backy, we live in a culture where for some ""sporty"" is equated to big nasty V8s that go in a straight line really fast, and occasionally make a very wide left turn. There's just no reasoning with such people. :shades: I heartily agree on your first three choices, though I'd specify the Golf TDI and skip the base model. I do have to take slight exception to that Elantra GT you've got up there, that's REALLY a stretch for me. it's a reasonably comfortable cruiser but didn't feel tossable to me at all. Hyundai's aiming more for the Toyota crowd than the Ford crowd there. ","Posts: 2,743",Member

You noticed I said 3, ""maybe"" 4-5?The Elantra GT is ""sporty"" to me. It looks sporty just standing still. With the steering feel (adjustable) dialed up all the way, it feels secure on the road. As great as the Mazda3? No. But we're talking slushboxes here, folks, meaning I think utility/comfort win out over sheer sportiness. And the Elantra GT beats the Mazda3 hands-down on utility & comfort.If the Elantra GT isn't sporty to you, I can't see how the Impreza would be sporty, especially the 2.0L CVT variant we are discussing here. Very nice hatch, but not all that sporty in my book. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Well, with the Impreza, the low mounted engine and the AWD give it tossability, even with a relatively soft suspension and a *shudder* CVT. It's underpowered though, and the steering is overboosted (then again, so is everyone not named Mazda, heh). Probably a matter of opinion, but I'd put the Impreza just above the Elantra GT on the sportiness scale. Not by much, mind you, but I would. ","Posts: 2,743",Member

Re: Versa...My daughter has an 09 SL hatchback, CVT, bought new, closing in on 70k miles.You can read my posts about it on the Nissan Versa section.Great on gas, and most would probably say it has excellent pickup for the size engine.She had a bearing noise issue in the transmission, but it never stranded her, and Nissan did a total transmission replacement at 49k miles. Zero costs to her. No issues since.My biggest complaint is that the door panels are poorly upholstered and the adhesive covering the armrests has ""released"". That shouldn't have happened in a 3-5 year old car that has been maintained well. No other interior issues. Comfortable front seats...No, it doesn't have he ride or power of many other nicer cars, but then again, it doesn't have the associated costs, either.If I was in the market, I would probably wait a bit for the new, revamped hatch to hit the markets.

I currently own a 2003 Mazda Protege with 153k miles.

It also has quite a bit of cosmetic damage from having been hit twice. I think it's just about time for a new car, one of my choosing finally.

Unfortunately I'm not a fan of their look or any touring model for that matter, even though they're usually recommended over the regular sedan or coupe models. A dealer near me has a 2010 Elantra Sedan for $12,948 with 21,858 miles. This sounds like a fairly good deal and I would assume it's nearly just as just as good as the touring.I'm going to start test driving some cars tomorrow. The first 2 will be the Mazda3 (Dealer 1 - 2008 $12,990/ 53,293 miles, Dealer 2 - 2009 $12,911/ 30,916 miles) and 2008 Chevy Impala ($12,790/ 58,798 miles). After that will be the 2010 Elantra and 2008 Suzuki SX4 ($12,301/ 27,228 miles). ",Posts: 4,Member

You need to narrow down your list some more, you are all over the map from subcompacts to full-sized cars. Consider your requirements--what is most important to you? Interior room? Fuel economy? Smooth ride? Safety? Handling? Reliability?Some thoughts on each:Nissan Sentra - I have a 2010 2.0S CVT and it's a nice little car: roomy for its size, smooth ride for a small car, can average over 30 mpg around town and upper 30s highway with a light foot, and has been perfect reliability-wise. Downsides are it lacks steering feel and is not very responsive with the CVT. But a good choice in a smaller car for a family--just not very exciting.Mercury Milan - I think this could be a good choice for you with the I4 as it's pretty economical, roomy, good crash safety,and has a nice blend of ride and handling. And they're reliable. Any reason you are not also looking at its sister car, the Fusion?Toyota Corolla (2010-2011) - Reliable and good FE. That's it. I think there's much better choices in this price range. Not very roomy.Mazda3 (2008-2009) - A blast to drive but not very roomy. Get the 2.0L if you get this car, the 2.5L is peppier but worse FE.Chevrolet Impala (2008-2010) - A boat. If you like land yachts, this is the one for you. Can get low 30s on the highway but you won't get anywhere near 30 in overall driving.Chevrolet Malibu (2008-2009) - I'd go with the Milan/Fusion in this class.Hyundai Elantra (2010) - A decent little car, very roomy for its size, reliable, but an outdated design. If you get this one, try to get the SE as it has ESC (GLS doesn't) and a little better handling with the larger rims. You can probably find one with a lot of factory 5-year warranty left, which is a plus. Also if you get one be sure to get one made Dec. 2009 or later as those cars got crash-safety improvements.Suzuki SX4 (2008) - Not a bad little car and has AWD, but how many Suzuki dealers are near you? I'd worry about whether Suzuki will be selling cars here in the future.Kia Rio (2010) - Probably the worst car on your list. Cramped (subcompact) and poor crash safety. No ESC available (I think the 2010s had ABS at least). I'd steer clear of this one if I were you. Actually, you can find a 2012 Rio starting around $14k and those are much nicer cars, if basic.Saturn Aura - Not a bad car, but I much prefer the Milan (or Fusion) in this class. VW Jetta - Go for 2010 or earlier as the newer Jettas took a step back. Try to get a VW Certified car with factory warranty. Reliability is improved from the past, and they ride and drive very nicely. Also roomy for a small car.You might also check out the Rabbit/Golf 4-doors, they're much more versatile than the Jetta.Honda Civic - Not all that roomy but fun to drive and good FE, good safety also, and will be reliable. Problem is, you'll pay a premium for the Honda reputation. Can probably get more car for your money with some of the others e.g. Milan or Jetta. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Have to disagree with the last paragraph, Backy. The Civic is all you say it is except safe. Dig a little deeper and you'll find that they're pretty lousy in side protection.But in this price range, Honda did make a car that suits the requirements: the 2006-07 Accord. I did a lot of driving of used Accords vs Fusions of this vintage -- i.e., 7th-generation Accord, first-generation Fusion. I wanted to buy the Fusion because I'd always like to support an American company if possible and I thought its resale value would be lower than the Accord.But a 2007-9 Fusion with a four cylinder just feels tired and sounds tired at 70,000 miles or so. In contrast, the Accords almost always feel great at well over 100,000 if they've been maintained. The Ford interiors weren't as nice as the Accords when they were new, but they're much worse with age. The plastics have that look, feel and smell of material that can't sustain years of exposure to sun and temperature extremes. Not so with the Accord. Engine and suspensions also show more of a decline, in my estimation.On top of all that, the Fusions weren't priced any better than the Accords that I found available. This was about a year ago -- things may have changed.DON'T consider the 2008 Accord, though. That was maybe the worst year ever for that car in terms of reliability. Economy is better, too, with the 2006-07 (the 7th generation ran from 2003-07, but they only made side curtains standard on 2005-2007. 06-07 has slightly improved power and other tweaks.)

""pretty lousy in side protection""? How do you figure that? The last-gen Civics e.g. 2010 scored Good (highest score) on the IIHS side crash tests, and also scored highly on the NHTSA tests (4 stars driver, 5 stars passenger). Seems like much better than ""lousy"" to me!The 2007 Accord would be a good choice, I agree, especially with the stick. Problem would be finding one with low miles. And it wasn't one of the cars the OP listed. If we start listing everyone's favorite (I see a Lexus IS and/or Toyota pickup and/or Buick in the future of this discussion  ), it will make it a really long list! ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I would really check out the Corolla. They've been around a long time, are super reliable, get great gas mileage, and are generally pretty cheap to buy and repair. Like most of the cars on your list, they're basic, funcitonal compact cars. Mazda 3 is more fun but not as reliable as a used car.Used Civics are fine but really shake you up if you have to take a long trip.

I'll add my 2 cents, but first, a couple if questions for you?Is a warranty important to you? Will you, or a friend/indie shop be doing your service work?If a warranty is important, then a new car with fewer options might be the way to go. Now, my experience with some of the cars on your ""short"" list...My daughter had a 2006 Corolla, used it to commute 50 miles round-trip to college daily. Excellent gas mileage, and truly the easiest car I have ever serviced (oil/filter changes, etc). Great reliability, but basic transportation. Will run forever with basic care. Beware, the latest generation changed to electric power steering, and many have disliked the new steering enormously!A friend bought a 2009 Sentra, loaded with all options. Second only to the Corolla regarding general maintenance (I do it for him). Great mpg, and overall nice car. It appears to be slightly larger than the Corolla, but not by much...no problems after 40K miles.Never owned a Suzuki, one reason being their dealerships in my area (SC upstate) don't stay open very long. Personally, I would avoid any domestic product Pre-bailout. The construction quality in the last couple of years has improved dramatically. Others may disagree, some strongly, but the quality surveys over the last few years pretty much agree with my analysis. Of course, as usual, there are exceptions...decide accordingly.Civic is a great and reliable car, but I agree with others that is a bumpy ride. Again, others may disagree, but German autos (I have 3 currently, 2 bmws 1 Mini and had a New Beetle 2002-2009) are generally a bit more expensive, when it comes to parts/repairs. Some owners have outstanding luck, others get to know all the VW shop personnel on a first name basis...I have zero experience with the others on your list, with one exception... Mazda. I had a base model Mazda pickup around 20 years ago, and it was reliable... No problems, but there wasn't much on it to break to begin with...That's my take... Good luck! ","Posts: 3,490",Member

The Fusion and Milan share powertrains.If you mainly want fuel economy and reliability, then the Corolla could be a good fit for you... BUT be sure you take it for a long drive and are OK with the steering and interior room. There's a lot of Corollas in fleets e.g. Hertz, so it would be easy to rent one for a day or two to get a real good idea how you like it. Some of the other cars e.g. Sentra are readily available as rentals also. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I just got back from test driving a 2008 Impala and Malibu while just looking at the Mazda3. The Impala had some pick-up/power, honestly I didn't quite like the extra kick behind the acceleration.....maybe I'm just not used to it. The interior was nice with leather heated seats. The car does control sort of boat like though, not as much as my girlfriends 2001 Impala. It's off my list, it just didn't do it for me.I then took the Malibu on the road. I could tell instantly that it was a much better car. It was quite, drove incredibly smooth, and the steering (electric) was nice and tight. The interior was also MUCH nicer than the Impala, odd considering it's supposed to be a step down. It's $1,000 over my price range though, but I loved it.Then I looked at the Mazda3. I didn't even bother taking it for a ride because this particular one was not well kept. You could tell that the original owner was a smoker. The interior had several imperfections as well. The seats were fairly uncomfortable and the back seat is cramped. I started the car and it just didn't feel or sound right. I do still want to test drive a nicer kept one, so hopefully the 2009 on my list is better.The only Corolla I would be happy with would be the 2011 model (if I haven't said that before...I forget). The 2010 is ok, but only with a spoiler. I'd get a lot of reliability out of it and great mpg, but it would prob be kind of boring. I need to find a Milan, but they're not as common. That or I'm over looking them since they may not be in my price range. I did come across some Fusions in my range, but they're probably the first make model that I don't care for. I also heard that they weren't great cars when the first came out, it wasn't until their redesign that won it awards apparently. ",Posts: 4,Member

The 2006 Honda Civic sedan received a three-star rating for side protection for the front passenger. The 2006-11 coupe's side protection for the driver was rated ""marginal"" for torso protection and ""average"" for pelvis/leg protection.I agree that we shouldn't start mentioning cars we like that have no relation to the poster's needs or stated preferences, but when he's looking at Milans, Impalas, 3s, and Corollas, clearly the 2006-07 Accord is within the range of consideration. In terms of mileage, I don't think it's essential to find one with low mileage because they hold up well, as I discussed. I also know there are many, many of them available of low and not-so-low mileage in his $14,000 and under price range. ",Posts: 50,Member

The best cars to buy used for low money are big, depreciating old people's cars.http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=90459030Here is a Buick Lacrosse CXS. This would actually be my #1 pick for the OP, because it's basically a fancy Malibu, but with the suspension and engine out of a first generation Cadillac CTS (just this CXS trim model). The engine's been tuned for low-end torque, though, so it pulls like a diesel through all of its gears. (peak torque is about 500rpm off of idle!)Leather, sunroof, traction control, safety features, and on and on - the thing's loaded. But because it's a *Buick*, it suffers from old-people-itis and depreciates rather quickly.(note - the other trims have no such engine or suspension upgrades and drive like rental cars - very disappointing - avoid them)Edit: It drives a lot like a late 90s E Class or Volvo S60 - not wobbly or bouncy ""GM"" at all, and it has no power gaps between gears (a first for any GM car, IME). The transmission is a standard 4 speed unit, which is optimal as it's also one of the most reliable ever made. You don't need tons of gears if you have loads of low end power.

He was looking at the Malibu and similar larger cars. They simply don't get 32mpg in real world driving, at least not without a puny engine, overpriced hybrid technology, or sacrificing ride, size, and features. A car like this (this specific model, actually) is loaded and drives as well as anything Honda or Toyota are making.GM makes the most reliable automatics, and their V6 engines are top-notch. He might pay a little more for fuel, but it'll take him a long time to make up the difference since the GM car will have a much lower price versus most of the imports. Now GM is very hit and miss, I'll have to admit. They make a superb vehicle only every few years, and it's usually unfortunately a top trim model of something nobody has their eye on. Or that is very low production. This is one of their gems, but since it's buried in reams of rental listings and off of absolutely everyone's radar, it's dirt cheap.CTS engine and suspension. In a Buick. For the price of a new Yaris. The OP should definitely check it out. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi, I've been researching cars for a couple of months now but I just can't find one that meets my needs as far as fuel economy, look, and cost to maintain.

I also like the new Mazda3 body, just to give you an idea of what body type appeals to me. The only thing that deters me from a BMW is the cost to maintain.

""cost to maintain""...If that's a significant factor in your decision, I would suggest you omit searching any traditional ""luxury"" brand vehicle.Just because a car cost twice as much, it in no way implies twice the reliability. In fact, this type of vehicle, as a rule, requires more in maintenance costs, if or no other reason that 1- it omens with more items, ergo more items to fail, and 2- parts on higher $ cars costs more $$$.Stick with more mainstream, mass produced vehicles.

If you like how the Mazda3 looks, why not get a Mazda3?

Used, and low cost to maintain... You're left with four choices1 - A Jeep Wrangler. Super cheap to keep running. Manual of course. Automatic and Chrysler are not to be said together.(except as a warning) 2 - A Crown Vic/Grand Marquis - Cheap to run, cheap to fix, and indestructible. Bad fuel economy, though.3 - The lowest cost car to maintain/buy parts for of the imports in the last decade was a Toyota Celica with a manual transmission.4 - A cheap Tacoma pickup truck with manual. Note - the Tacoma was 2nd lowest price to keep running. Of course, get 4X4. 4 cylinder engine only as well - the V6 is needlessly thirsty for a small gain in speed.A lot of these ""reliable"" cars cost you an absolute fortune if something goes bad. A 2005 TSX is asking for a 4-6K repair bill for the transmission when, not if it goes bad. Most automatics die around 10-12 years old, IME. Manuals are often a simple clutch job and many sellers will get one done before they sell the vehicle if it's somewhat worn. (they can recoup most of the cost and sell it very quickly).

What are you smoking, because I'm thinking of disconnecting from reality myself this weekend. :shades:To the OP: check out used Subarus, they're almost as fun to drive as Mazdas, and AWD helps with both handling and winter traction (if that's a concern). Some of the older Honda Civics are decent in a ""me too"" way, but I'd go with a used Ford Focus first. ","Posts: 2,743",Member

So get a stick TSX for cryin' out loud! They exist! And they're fun. I was only giving an example for budgetary reasons.A Jeep Wrangler is NOT a sedan... it's not even a car.A Celica is NOT a sedan. At least it's a car! Forget about carrying anyone bigger than a munchikin in back though.A Tacoma is NOT a sedan... nor is it a ""car"".And a Crown Vic has about as much in common with a 3 Series or Mazda3 as an oxcart has in common with a Porsche.

Hi, I've been researching cars for a couple of months now but I just can't find one that meets my needs as far as fuel economy, look, and cost to maintain.His overall goal is to get a good reliable vehicle. Since he can't find a sedan that meets his needs, he obviously has to let the ""sedan"" part of the equation change. If you've run through all the choices, then you need to lok at things not on your initial list. He's obviously gotten to the point where he's frustrated, so I mentioned a few other non-small-sedans to possibly point him in other directions.My list was purely based upon cost to own, and not on any other factors.1 - The Celica gets a special mention as it's quick, sporty, and dirt cheap to keep running. The lack of rear doors is hardly a problem, and the fact that it's a hatchback kind of offsets that for a young buyer, since you can actually use it to haul medium sized items in a pinch.2 - The Wrangler is a SUV. Gas mileage on it and the Tacoma is mediocre. The advantage with both though is great bad-weather performance and the ability to tow and haul items. Yes, they also make extended cab and 4 door Tacomas as well. 3 - The Crown Vic and similar cars (say a big Buick or Chevy sedan) are good because of their dirt cheap purchase price. If you can get a 2008 Crown Vic that was never used as a rental or taxi for $10K, or a 2008 Camry for $15K, that $5K buys you an immense amount of fuel. Several years worth, in fact (difference in MPG). It also ties up a lot less cash in a loan, less for registration, insurance, and yes, eventually repairs. The last time I was in the Toyota dealer (getting a part for a 80s 4Runner/rock crawler), a guy was complaining about a $4000 bill to get the transmission in his Corolla replaced. A Crown Vic's is $1500 all day long to replace. Yes, it's big, it's heavy, and it's not sporty, but it's undeniably a car that you wont go broke driving. The Grand Marquis is the luxury model similar to say, a Cadillac or Buick, and has zero ""taxi/cop car"" DNA in it - it looks like a proper sedan, with alloy wheels, chrome, and a good paint job. Leather, often a sunroof, premium sound, and so on. They sold for $22-24K after rebates at the end of the year, so a 2008 for $10K is absolutely possible.http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- gId=96834628Once the 2013s come out in a few weeks, expect this to be the norm as prices will drop another year's worth. note - The GM 4 speed units and the ones used in the Crown Vic/etc are the only automatics that I'd personally trust to buy 5 or 6 years used. Any car that I would be looking at otherwise would have most of the cost of a new transmission deducted from the price right off the top.Everything else, it has to be a manual. Cheapskate economics 101 demands a manual transmission and low priced parts. MPG is only a factor if you're driving 20K+ miles a year. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

The point with Chrome and all of that is that it doesn't get stuff thrown at you or your car keyed in most areas of town where they think a Crown Vic is a police or government car. The leather seats, premium sound, sunroof, and other amenities, plus the fact that almost all were sold to individuals makes it a better deal than a Crown Vic. Interesting fact - less than 5% of all Crown Vics were sold to individuals and are still owned by their first owner. Good luck finding one of those. You're better off getting a Grand Marquis from a retired person. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Did you notice the title of this thread: Need Some Help Choosing a Sedan! ??So the OP is looking for a sedan. Not a truck. Not an SUV. Not a coupe or 2-door hatch. A SEDAN. And he was clear that the kind of sedan he favors is a small one, ala 3 Series (but can't afford maintenance on that) or a Mazda3. He'd like good fuel economy. The Crown Vic is a boat and has terrible fuel economy compared to something like the Mazda3. He specifically said he's interested in the Mazda3 but is looking for alternatives to that before buying one.Also he's looking for a reliable sedan. The Wrangler (which isn't a sedan) is NOT a reliable vehicle (cf. Consumer Reports). So why mention it? A, it isn't a sedan. B, it isn't reliable. C, it doesn't get good fuel economy and that was another requirement. Is there any way, any way at all, you could respond to these folks looking for help in buying a car with some suggestions that actually meet their requirements, and not just your same recommendations again and again and again, no matter what the OP is looking for?

This forum historically has been a bit of a catch-all place for people looking for advice on vehicles of all types who aren't sure exactly what they want, since a lot of the smaller specific forums have little or no traffic, and many vehicles are similar to sedan models (Fit, Matrix, most crossovers, etc). If he's run out of sedans to look at, perhaps he needs something that's not a quite a normal sedan. Rather than just say ""go to the other forum"", it's nicer to try to figure out the problem here if we can.As for the Wrangler, I mentioned it only because it's super easy to keep running. It does break down more frequently, but parts cost less than half what parts on, say, a Honda do. He was asking what's cheap to keep running at the time, and that's what that list was about. Toyota trucks also made the list because you can keep one running with hand tools, duct tape, and some WD-40. What I personally recommend, though?I personally think a small cheap wagon or crossover might work better for his needs, but finding one with manual and a 4 cylinder engine (so MPG is acceptable) is more common these days in the rest of the world than it is here in the U.S. I think the RAV 4 is about the only one left, and luckily, second generation RAV4s are quite affordable. Is it a SUV? Well, no. It's more like a raised small sedan with AWD that has the exterior styling of a SUV tacked on. A 2005 would be a good choice. He'd probably not even pay close to $10K for it. My last Toyota still ran when I sold it with nearly 300K on it. A couple of years older isn't a factor with most of them, as long as the condition is good.Note - the Jeep Compass and Patriot also are what I'd call sedans/wagons made up to look like a SUV as well. Get a base model Patriot with manual (nothing to break, quite literally). Avoid the CVT like the plague it is. Jeep does make good manuals and at $14K, it's the cheapest wagon/crossover/(not sure what to call it - heh) out there. The 5 year/100K mile drive-train warranty covers you for a while, which lowers your cost quite a bit. (no 5-6 year old car will be without $500 or more a year in upkeep, oil changes, tires, and so on) http://www.truecar.com/prices-new/jeep/patriot-pricing/Note - that price includes the delivery charge, so the base price is actually just a few dollars above $14K. (Truecar and Cars Direct add this into their prices, which sometimes leads to a bit of confusion vs the other sites)Something for him to maybe think about, since it's a pretty fun little vehicle to stomp around in due to the short gearing and light weight. It also gets 23/29mpg, which is more in the range he was looking for. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Expanding a bit on plekto's position that the forum is a place to provide information on vehicles of all types because (despite their words to the contrary) the OPs DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, let me offer this piece of advice to the person seeking that narrowly defined class called ""sedans.""Get a rickshaw. Really, these are super-affordable ways of getting around. Just look at Asia! The initial costs are pretty low. The only trick is finding the ""fuel"" as it were. Of course, outside of the U.S. market, this isn't always as much of a concern. Here, we have the nanny-state government mandating our choices, so we can't just, say, get an indentured servant to take us on our Costco runs. And even if we could, you'd probably have to get a second servant to help pull when you've got the rickshaw piled full of 24-can cases of Diet Coke, 75-lb. dog-food bags, a 72-inch TV and enough laundry detergent to last until the next summer Olympics. But they're an established, reliable form of transportation, with a few centuries of testing to get out all the bugs (termites excepted, of course.) Now, you might think this is silly, and that's okay. There are still plenty of other choices on the market -- like a camel or an elephant or a broomstick or magic carpet or just clicking your heels three times and saying, ""There's no place like home, there's no place like home."" The point is to be open-minded and to be willing to listen to other people's suggestions, no matter how delusional those suggestions are! ",Posts: 50,Member

What I personally like and what I recommend are entirely two different things. If I could have any new car today, it would be a Porsche Cayman, most likely. I love small fast cars. I think Honda really did a bad thing when they killed off the S2000 without a real replacement in the works. If it was ANY car, it would probably be a late 60s Skylark convertible. But those are silly money as of late.As for the issue of what vehicle, I merely made choices based upon low cost to own and buy. If the OP has enough money for a better car, then he should of course get something like an IS300, G35, S60, GS, or other used luxury or higher performance sedan. Used luxury is often built better and lasts longer than a cheap car. And has more options and safety equipment as well, as a rule.The problem comes when he wants something used for very little money, and most of the things he looks at he doesn't like or feels like, well, they are the overpriced econoboxes that they really are. So thinking outside the box might be his next step.As for the OP, if he wants a normal sedan and automatic, then the IS300 is probably the best of the used crop. Nice sport sedan feel and a great engine. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi,I'm seeking advice on choosing a new small car. I currently drive a 98 Corolla and am leaning toward a Prius, but I'm also considering a Corolla and a Hyundai Elantra (possibly a Civic too). My most significant considerations when buying a car are dependability and safety, and Consumer Reports scores the Prius higher on reliability than the Corolla, Elantra, Civic, etc. However, JD Power ranks the Corolla highest on initial quality. Are CR and JD Power considered reliable arbiters of vehicle reliability?One problem for me is that I need auto on/off headlights (to which I've gotten accustomed in my 98 Corolla). However, it appears that Toyota has entirely eliminated any auto headlamps in the Corolla line! Even the Prius Two and Three do not have auto on/off headlights, just auto-off. I've emailed Toyota, and they seem to say that with the Prius Two and Three, I could have the headlight switch set to ""on"" permanently, and the lights will come on automatically every time we start the car (after they were turned off automatically), so I guess this is a fix, even if it's wasteful.As for the Elantra, auto headlamps is only an option on the limited model (unless I'm mistaken and auto-off is available in lower models), which makes the Elantra almost as expensive as the Prius!I can't justify the Prius on entirely financial considerations, as I only drive about 5k miles a year (mostly city driving), but I figure that I could still come out ahead if I have to spend less on maintenance, as it gets such high ratings for reliability (though perhaps that's b/c Prius owners may be more conscientious about maintenance?). Also, I would like to get at least 10 years out of my new car, so I guess I'm a bit concerned about the Prius battery.I'd appreciate any advice you may have. thanks  ",Posts: 13,Member

BG: as the old adage goes, if it ain't broken, don't fix it. If you like the Corolla (and I have owned many to include my Vibes), I would buy another Corolla. It is a fantastic car and should meet your 10 year minimum requirement. If you happen to need something a bit bigger for whatever reason, I'd look at the Camry. Otherwise, in the Corolla size range, don't rule out the Honda Fit, and since I'm confident in saying this: your current Corolla is still functioning just fine, wait a month or two to see what the new Nissan Versa hatchback brings us just in case you would like the versatility of a hatchback. As a ""Pontiac Corolla"" owner several times over, I do feel your pain on the auto headlight issue. I love just getting in my ""Corolla"" and starting the car, knowing the lights will go on/off by themself. But alas, in the end, I will leave you with the same adage I began with: if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Keep your current Corolla until you really feel the need to push it over a cliff. That's what is called satisfaction on money well spent.  ","Posts: 1,340",Member

Realize that for any car with auto-off headlights (which includes even the Elantra GLS), you could leave the headlamp switch ""on"" and it would then be auto-on/off. Except I think that function does take a little juice from the battery, so given how little you drive that might not be a good idea. Also many cars including the Elantra have DRLs, so you don't really need/want the headlights on all the time.If you aren't stuck on the Corolla, Prius, or Elantra... two other new small cars with automatic headlights are the Focus SE (or Titanium), and the Forte SX (top trim, but might cost you less than the top-end Elantra). The Focus is far superior to the Corolla IMO and beats the Elantra and Prius in ride/drive, although is tighter in back than those two cars. The Focus SE sedan would cost a lot less than the Prius or the top-end Elantra. The Forte is not as nice a car as the Elantra or Prius but better than the Corolla, IMO. Reliability is decent and it's an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Another feature of the Focus and Forte is that they have hatchback variants, if you like the idea that the Prius is a hatchback. The Elantra has a hatch variant also, but as on the sedan, automatic on/off headlamps are only on the loaded model, list around $25k. Of all of those new cars, looks like the Focus would get you automatic on/off headlamps for the least bucks.You said ""new small car"". Is there some reason you will not consider a slightly used car, maybe a Certified car? That way you can still have a manufacturer's warranty (for up to 10 years from date of original sale in the case of makes like Hyundai and Kia). You could then afford upscale features like auto-on headlights. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

hi backy,thanks for your reply. I did not realize that the Elantra GLS has auto-off headlights. Where I can find this kind of info on Hyundai's website?Where can I read more about how leaving the headlamp switch ""on"" might drain the battery? I drive my car several times a week, if that matters.Do you think there's any chance the 2013 Prius might have auto on-off headlamps in the lower end models?re: a used car, I bought my 98 Corolla used in 2003, and I had more problems with it from 2003-2006 than from 2007-present. I just don't want to deal with the uncertainty about whether the used car was properly maintained. I realize this might not make sense financially (esp since Toyota only recently dropped auto on/off headlights from the Corolla line-up), but I would prefer to pay extra for peace of mind.maxx4me, while my 98 Corolla is running fine now, my mechanic indicated I would need some work done in the medium-term, so that's why I'm looking into buying a new car.

I'll be retiring in a couple of years & am thinking about a new small car--hatchback or wagon. Utility is high on the list, meaning I have to be able to put my bicycle inside. We already have a small pickup and SUV. Local dealers are D3 and Toyota. Honda and Nissan are 35-45 miles away. Everything else is at least 85 miles away. Current daily driver is MINI Cooper, but it's just too small and bouncy on backroads, that I will be trading in. Current list to look at include Ford C-Max, Hyundai Elantra GT, Kia Forte 5-door & Kia Soul. I cannot get comfortable in a Toyota Matrix. The cars I have had include Ford Pinto stationwagon, Plymouth Horizon hatchback, Chevy Citation hatchback, Plymouth Sundance hatchback, Hyundai Accent hatchback & Kia Spectra5. Comments?

Well, Hyundai's website isn't the only source of information on Hyundais. Owner forums are a good source of info too... as you realize since you posted your question here. This might be helpful re auto-off headlights on the Elantra:http://www.elantraclub.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t32355.htmlI don't have a link re battery drain for the auto-off feature, I just remember reading many years ago that there is a drain, albeit a small one. I think it had to do with a circuit being open in order to trigger ""lights on"" when the car starts again. I've owned 3 Hyundais (2 Elantras) with this feature and it's never been a problem, but then I don't leave the lights on the ""on"" position for a long period of time. Maybe it would be a problem if someone left the car parked for several weeks.If you go to http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/features.html and click on the Features tab, it's easy to verify that the Prius Two and Three do NOT have auto on/off headlights but the Prius Four and Five do.

If it were me I'd stick with something where I know I can get local service and warranty repairs if I need them. Since it appears you don't want to consider a small SUV like the Escape or Equinox, and you want to buy new, I think your best bet of those you listed is the C-Max. Two other options, from Toyota, are the Venza (really more a Camry wagon than an SUV) and the Prius v. All fit in your under-$35k range. The Venza might be a little bigger than what you want.If you really don't mind driving a ways to see a dealer, another small car that is great on utility and can hold a bike is the Fit.

I was thinking of the Fit as well. And because you're already driving a Mini Cooper and it was not listed as one of the dealerships in your town, you are at least willing to drive some distance for repairs. Don't know how often you've had to do so with the Mini, but odds are that you'd have less of a need to visit the Honda dealer 35 miles away than the BMW-Mini dealer, wherever it is. An argument for the Venza is that it no doubt will ride much better than the Fit. If the Mini's ride is too rough, the Venza would be a dramatic improvement. Much quieter, too, I'm sure. Fuel economy won't be nearly as good as the Fit, but it would be a more luxurious vehicle. If you decide that the C-Max really is the perfect vehicle, I'd still recommend waiting a year to let them work out problems. This allegedly is no longer an issue with cars, but there seem to be cases from time to time still that show it can be -- Ford has had problems with the Escape and Honda did with the 2008 Accord, for example.

I'd recommend a Corolla wagon, if only because of the extra versatility.AKA a Toyota Matrix  The Corolla itself seems to be more of the same Toyota is de-contenting it a bit since it's a ""budget"" car in their minds and marketing.

I'd consider the Matrix only as a last resort. Having driven them as rentals, they are one of the few cars I would put on my rental profile as ""NO!"" if I could (can't put a specific car on Hertz' profile). Actually I'd do the same with the Corolla, and Yaris if I could. Cheap interior trim, noisy, less-than-ideal driving position for starters. The only plus is there would be many used Matrices to choose from if the OP decides to go the used route.Also it's likely the Matrix doesn't have the auto-on headlights feature that the OP really wants, since the Corolla doesn't have it.

Also, having moved from a big city to a small, way-out-in-the-farthest-suburbs town, I can tell you that getting service on a Volvo is going to be a major undertaking.The best advice I can give to someone living in a smaller market area is to buy something that is the most common vehicle you can live with. A Ford Focus might be a good choice (though I don't know about a bike in that). You want to be able to take the vehicle to ANY local mechanic, not just the dealership, and know that parts or knowledge won't be a major issue for regular maintenance, non-warranty, or after-warranty problems. I started out in this small town with my Infiniti G35. Very hard to find someone local who was comfortable working on it or had good knowledge of it. Replaced it with a used Ford Escape, as I noticed about 1 in every 10 people in this town seems to have one. EVERY mechanic has seen a bunch of these, so getting service is never an issue.

Thanks for the comments. I have never found a Toyota that fits me as a driver, except trucks. I have a 2011 Tacoma regular cab. My wife has a 2010 Honda Element. The Venza is a little bigger than I want. I am short. The problem with larger cars in general is that they have larger seats, and the seat bottom is too long, hitting the back of my knee. So driving them is tiring. As Kirstie said, getting service for a Volvo would be hard. Also, I would like four doors.The earliest I would be buying will be next year. So I have plenty of time.

There's a big difference in cargo capacity between the Fit and the Spectra5, because the Fit has a lower load floor than the Spectra5.

Thanks, tifighter, for your suggestions tho am not sure I'm in agreement withthem. Seems to be mixed opinions on the turbo - too much heat being the issue.Hmmm on the RDX - tho it's the new ""in"" thing, it felt a bit ""squishy"" (i.e. Lexified)to me. Having been a previous Acura owner (1988 Legend that I liked), I wouldn'tmind owning another Acura car - if only the SportWagon had more power!Your last sentence sums up my big problem!!

the first gen RDX was anything but squishy and was not slow; maybe you can find a leftover 12 or CPO out there. Reliability for the turbo has been excellent (check consumer reports, etc.) Too early to say on the Sportage. As far as wagons go, you looked at the CTS and TSX. There's the Outback/Venza/Crosstour class, all with available V6. The other options are the Euro wagons (Audi allroad, new BMW 3 next year, MB E, and the Volvo XC70). Bring your wallet.

I think 2010 and later RDX was available in FWD and AWD, so you have the option either way. The Crosstour I think offered both as well, starting with the 12 model year. Both are going to feel quicker than the base TSX. ","Posts: 3,007",Member

I want a small, AWD sedan. I currently have a 2006 Lexus IS 250 AWD and love it, but feel silly just buying the same car again--not much has changed.

If you don't mind saving some money, and the loss of some oomph, take a look at the Impreza (high-end trim of course).For more bucks, there's always the 3 Series with AWD and the A4 Quattro. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

What are some of the things you like about a car? I assume the AWD is a must have? The Mercedes is the closest in size to the IS but I've never been real impressed with them. Marginal performance/economy, high upkeep, etc. It seems you keep your cars for awhile so I would rule that one out. The TL and G37 are quite a bit bigger and better performing than what you're used to. This is why I asked what you like because if performance isn't high on your list there may be some non-luxury brands that would live up to your expectations. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Good suggestion on the Volvo.If it were me with that list, It would be TL, S60, maybe G37. I see so many of the Germans here in the bay area that I just couldn't do it. The TL is a goofy car, but the reviews of the SH-AWD model are uniformly good, especially the manual, which would make it worth a test drive to me. Shoot, I might even test drive a Taurus SHO too, as a total wild card. ","Posts: 3,007",Member

What is wrong with a Camry LE? It is well equipped and you might find a discounted one at the end of the year. It will last forever and rides well. It is comfortable on the road. You could even look for a 2011 or 12 used one and get an extended warranty. If you are going to keep the car for 10 years or more I would check the Consumer Reports dependability ratings for whatever car you decide on. There used to be a base model of the Camry under the LE.

I think you've narrowed it down pretty well. Keep in mind the Infinti and Acura are both quite a bit bigger than what you're used to. Obviously there are a few others options...BMW 3 series and Cadillac ATS. They have AWD and lots of features. I'd trust keeping either of them longer than an Audi or MB. What about a Hatch? On the low-end and a total wild card is the Nissan Juke. Love-it/Hate-it styling but cool little cars with AWD. Mini also has an AWD hatch (Clubman) that's cool, small, but might be quirky on the reliability side. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I did some research on which S60 models are available with in-dash navigation. The 2012 S60 T6 AWD offers it as an option. The 2013 S60 T5 AWD ""Platinum"" includes integrated NAV standard.The 2013 Ford Fusion Titanium AWD is also worth a look, even though it doesn't wear a 'premium' nameplate. It looks more upscale than most of the models we've been discussing. It also has most of the newest safety features. The Titanium has a Rear View Camera and Rear Sensing System standard.

Number 4 is going to limit your choices...Numbers 5/6 should be merged... If a car gets 30 mpg on premium fuel, that's cheaper than 27 mpg on regular.... so, restricting your choices to regular fuel only might be a false economy..Most RWD cars are upscale...so, almost all will use premium...  If a sporty coupe is okay, there is the Hyundai Genesis coupe, Scion FR-S or Subaru BR-Z. Though, seating for four in any of those would be marginal..The BMW X1 is basically a 5-door hatchback.... the cheapest model comes in RWD only... of course, premium fuel..Porsche 911 coupe has back seats...

I can think of at least ONE new car that exists if it can be FWD instead of RWD... Kia Soul Base. Starts around $15k before negotiation and for 2013 is actually pretty well equipped, including a 6 speed stick and Bluetooth. And rides pretty nice also (tested one the other day, albeit an automatic).Actually there's other possibles here as well if only the RWD requirement is lifted--most of these would be stripped, but could be had ~$15k new:* Chevy Sonic and Spark* Ford Fiesta* Hyundai Accent GS - might be able to find one around $15k at discount* Kia Rio base 5-door (at a discount... but for the money I'd take the Soul)* Mazda2 ","Posts: 18,946",Member

You could buy a car that met all those criteria, but it would have been made in the 1970s. The two OPEC oil embargoes led manufacturers to find ways to save weight and they jumped on the front-wheel-drive bandwagon as one of the solutions. Broadly speaking, FWD has been the norm since the 1980s, with the exceptions of performance-oriented cars and large relics of that earlier era like the Ford Crown Vic. Some models that had been FWD have moved back to RWD, but they tend to be large vehicles like the Chrysler 300. The smaller Chrysler 200 is FWD. The early Japanese imports, including the Corolla and Datsun 510, were RWD, as were the American models designed to compete with them, like the (cough-cough) Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. Honda's original and highly influential Civic and Accord were both FWD, as was the equally influential original Dodge Caravan. That's a long-winded explanation about why the car you're looking for doesn't exist on today's market. ",Posts: 50,Member

You really need to get over the ""buy new"" idea and get a good car that's just a few years old. You can get a 3-5 year old car 12-15K. Or just about any other 25-35K upper tier or entry level luxury midsize sedan. These represent your best long-term value as they have more safety items, more options, and are built with the idea that people will be driving them for 10+ years as opposed to their being purely rental fodder. Heavier doors, better seats, better brakes, a smoother engine, and so on. And often a LOT safer due to their added weight in a crash.Of course the best deals are Ford and GM due to their higher initial depreciation. About 3/4 of their cars are OK or worse, but the rest are much better than they used to be. Kind of like hidden gems, as it were. You mentioned the Spark, so you probably won't have an issue with domestic make.My recommendation then would be to get the following/something like it:http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=90459030What you are looking at is a Buick Lacrosse. But this specific model has the suspension and engine out of a Cadillac CTS. Plus leather, sunroof, a good radio, and all of the goodies. You'll not be hunched over driving it like in a lot of econoboxes. It drives like a dream and it's $13K. With under 30K miles on it, since most likely it was owned by an elderly person who barely drove it. Did I mention the Cadillac engine? This thing is a rocket. 0-60 in just over 7 seconds, and while that's not as ""fast"" some other cars, it has maximum torque at 1600rpm. Not 4000+. So it does transitions and responds much quicker than a typical sedan since it's at full power pretty much all the time. (kind of like driving a diesel just without the diesel issues)This car at fifteen years old (10 years from now) will be in better shape than a new econobox after 5 years. As for myself, I typically drive older luxury cars for this reason. If you don't abuse them you'll never wear out a full-size car.edit - note that there is a second choice that's also good. It's reliable, super cheap to fix, and despite getting OK MPG, the low low price more than makes up for it.http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listin- - gId=73962461It's big but it's also quite obviously not a taxi, rental car, or cop car. The whole idea behind that specific color (or the dark red) is to get rid of that image. It's an awesome vehicle in every way. If you are 6 ft tall, it's made for you. You get a big overbuilt car that easily could last another 150K miles and save a ton on repairs. Just keep it until the wheels fall off. Like the Buick, it comes pretty much loaded. I drove one of these for a while and it was awesome. Quiet, smooth as glass, and perfect for commuting to work and back.Keep in mind that this car is about two years old. It'll still probably have that new car smell and half the tread left on the original tires. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

If you are set on a new car, with your size you might try the Soul. Very roomy car, and I've seen base models (still all the key equipment, and a 6-speed manual) advertised for under $13k + T&L. That would fit your budget, depending on taxes in your state. Also good fuel economy and high marks for crash safety. And a 10-year warranty.Versa hatch is another option, not quite as roomy as the Soul but really good legroom for its size. Would need to be a base model to fit in your budget. Stay away from the Versa sedan... not nearly as nice a car as the hatch, IMO, and the hatch is more versa-tile. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

It simply won, because as much as I wanted ""new"", the amount of car that I could get a few years used was shocking by comparison.

It was a great deal because Acura is trying to clear out the old models and I couldn't find a slightly used one for less.

If expense and gas mileage are mainly driving your decision....it's not likely you'll come out ahead on any of these financially.

You can buy a new '12 Accord LXP for $18k pretty easily.....I'm betting that's far less than you paid for yours when new so you'll take a beating on trade.

You didn't provide enough information to narrow this down much. You have a wide range of vehicles on your list--from tiny subcompacts (Mazda2) to mid-sized cars with large-car interiors (Sonata and Optima). Think about what's most important to you: fun to drive? ride comfort? lots of passenger room? lots of cargo room? fuel economy? etc.The Fit Sport is a good around-town car if you want something small, fun to drive, good fuel economy, and versatile, but are ok with it being fairly noisy.If you want fun-to-drive but want something a little larger, the Mazda3 would be a good choice. Hatch is available if cargo room is important.The Elantra is a good choice if you don't mind relatively numb steering compared to a Fit or Mazda3, but want a smaller car with fairly roomy interior and a smooth ride. It does have a hatch version, Elantra GT, that has crisper steering than the sedan and IMO a nicer interior.Not sure why Sonata and Optima are on this list, since you are looking for a car to drive around town. They are pretty big for that purpose, but good values. But there's lots of other good cars in the same class, such as the new Accord LX, Altima, and Passat.One option you might consider since you'll be driving this car in-town a lot: a 2010+ Prius. Great fuel economy around-town, roomy interior for 4 adults, and a hatchback. But not engaging to drive. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

At akamrtoad...Taking all your concerns into consideration you should go with the Passat TDI SE with Sunroof and Navigation. You may not need the Navigation but that level gets you the fog lights and nicer wheels etc. Go with the Premium if you can afford it. You can acquire the SE with Sunroof and Nav for less than 30K. It has the BEST backseat room and great mileage, the mileage is usually better than advertised. Advertised is 42mpg on highway but people are getting almost 50mpg while doing 70mph on the highway.

I commend you for having a thorough list of needs.Unfortunately, its a TOUGH list when taken together. Since you mentioned the Camry, I'll assume you don't want a manual transmission.The biggest problem I see is the seating. As you said, finding one wide enough for that is damned near impossible. I know I wouldn't be able to do it in my volvo. The only new wagons I can think to check out are the Jetta wagon and Ford C-max Hybrid. I have no idea if they'd fit all the carseats. Probably not. Maybe the Passat. Again, I have no idea with those carseats. You have to get out there and try them.Otherwise, I'd be looking at the used market. A 2010 528i would get pretty close to your targets, I think. A little down on mileage (28mpg highway) but score high in sportiness. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

VW Passat TDI (turbo diesel.) Under $30K, EPA rated 30 mpg city, 40 hwy. I heard a guy saying he routinely gets 47 mpg with this car. Can't vouch for its reliability, but it's within an inch of the Camry in backseat dimensions and I'd guess it would be a lot more fun to drive.There's also the new Ford Fusion that should be out soon, with many trim options and better looks than in the past.

Extremely light weight, which is important for handling purposes in a front-wheel-drive car. I've never driven either, but they get very positive reviews from those who enjoy driving. I also read that they're relatively quiet, unlike the Fit.I doubt the Civic will be so different for 2013 that it's worth waiting for them -- they're stuck with that design for at least a couple more years. They can tweak it a bit, but this generation has been roundly booed. Your negative reaction to the Accord you're driving is widely shared -- the new one seems to address a lot of the misgivings people have about the 2008-12 size. By the way, I don't mean to sound down on Honda. My family owns three of them. As for the Mazda3, I had high hopes for the SkyActiv engine finally addressing the relatively poor MPG of the 3, but apparently the trade-off is that it's fairly stodgy in terms of performance.

Three car seats? Why wouldn't you want another mini-van? Seems like a good choice, until you get one kid out of a booster, and the twins out of carseats..I mean, I know why you don't want another minivan, but that seems like the perfect vehicle for your situation.... ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

Three car seats across is rough in anything smaller than a crew cab pickup. Nice part about a minivan or three row SUV is that you don't have to have them all in a row. If the size is an issue, you could consider a small people mover like the Mazda5. It'd be nice if the Ford C-Max also offered a third row but it doesn't currently do so... ","Posts: 2,743",Member

I hate to see it but I see you in another minivan. No other vehicle will give you the room and power you need. The newer ones get much better mileage than your old one. You don't mind a minivan, why not go with another? Yes, they'll be out of car seats but you'll be hauling around their friends too, and who would want to miss that fun? These are your minivan years. They'll be over before you know it. Advice from a mom of 3. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I've had friends try this and 3 seats in the rear means a minimum of about 60 inches across. Most car seats with the arms in a position where they can be raised suck up the entire rear seat position, leaving nothing in the middle for a booster if one is on each side. This means you're stuck with either something that is very boxy and upright so that the seats can be pushed out towards the edges or something that is very large.You can get everything that you want in a car except for MPG. You'll have to settle for about 25mpg. *(one exception, see below)Option 1A - A Chevy Colorado/GMC 1500 crew cab. It gets 18/25 mpg and while that's not 30mpg, it will fit the criteria quite well. It also will haul cargo and that's worth considering with kids in the mix. (bikes, trips to the mega-discount-warehouse, furniture for their room, etc) GM also makes the most reliable automatic transmissions. GM also has huge year-end incentives.It really does fit 2 seats and a booster. This is because the cab is boxy and unlike most cars, you really can push it all the way to the side.Option 1B: A Toyota Tacoma crew cab. This gets 24mpg highway. They used to offer a 4 cylinder version but it's now all V6 plus automatic. More expensive, a little more reliable. Toyota never offers year-end incentives that amount to much.Option 2A: A full size GM car. Get a Buick Lucerne with the V6 engine. The upside of these are that they can get up to 26-27mpg highway and are big and safe in a crash. It rides very nicely on long trips thanks to the long wheelbase and huge suspension. Option 2B: A Toyota Avalon. Toyota's version of the same thing. Big, heavy, but gets about the exact same MPG as a Camry. A win-win for those who need more space compared to the Camry. The downside, again, is that a CPO GM car or one a the end of the year is sometimes 5K or more less than a similar Toyota. Note - you can also get a third row vehicle, but precious few exist that have the third row ahead of the rear axle. This means the kid in the rear will be part of the crumple zone. Many minivans actually fail this criteria as well, so you;'re almost stuck with a Suburban is you want a 3rd row and something that is safe. Or perhaps an actual van.*****There is one vehicle that fits all of your criteria. A Jeep Patriot.NOTE - the 2013 model has slightly changed gearing, so it gets 1mpg better than the 2012. fueleconomy.gov lists it as 23/30 with the 2.0 engine and manual transmission. Jeep makes excellent manual transmissions, is it's the choice to get.It's actually a nice enough vehicle and really is not a SUV, either. It's more like a raised wagon. The pros are good visibility, good bad-weather performance, and a dirt cheap price. http://www.truecar.com/prices-new/jeep/patriot-pricing/2013/Note the $15500 price.(!) You can literally buy two of these for your budget, so it's a compelling choice. Ignore the NAV (honestly, your phone now does a similar job if you have an android or iPhone), forget about leather (kids will trash it anyways), and don't bother with the terrarium (sunroof) option. Forget the 4WD as well unless it's important to you. The middle trim model has everything you really want. Latitude model.- Premium Sound (a must have)- Green Paint (same as the ""Jeep"" green on the Wrangler - very nice looking)- Security and Cargo group (includes side airbags and homelink)That's it. Truecar/Cars Direct/etc have it quoted for $20K. Sure, you have to shift your own gears. But it'll get 30mpg and haul a lot of cargo as well. All without looking like a minivan.

Some folks are assuming alot about the carseats in question. At 3 years old, depending on the size of the children, they can be in high-back booster seats, which can take up way less room than a full ""baby"" seat. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

It's amazing, Plekto, how you continue to provide answers to questions that the OP didn't ask. He said he wanted a car, you give him suggestions for two trucks and a lousy SUV. He said he wanted something fun to drive, you give him the Buick Lucerne and Toyota Avalon. He said he wanted at least 30 mpg because of his long commute, you give him vehicles that get at best 24 mpg on the highway. Oh, and you also tell him what color vehicle he should get!Really, if you think your opinions are so valuable that they should be shared despite the fact that they're completely off base, why don't you just start your own blog and free up this space for people who honestly want to help the people who come here for advice?

He wants something that isn't a minivan. That's apparently his #1 criteria.He wants something new that can fit his kids in the rear all across. That's his #2 criteria.(see below) That unfortunately leaves him with big vehicles. Even with smaller car seats and a booster, 3 across just won't happen in anything smaller than a Avalon or Taurus. He's kind of out of luck on the ""fun to drive"" part since 3 across seating in the rear simply means a big vehicle.OR a third row. Yet, I researched all of them a few years ago, and kept up with the new models as well. Absolutely nothing smaller than a massive SUV or full sized van has the third row ahead of the rear crumple zone. So they *all* fail. Kids plus crumple zone equals a dead or mangled kid in a rear end crash. He has to have a two-row vehicle if he doesn't want a Surburban. Note - someone else did mention a truck before me, so chill out a bit. Because most trucks these days don't look like a SUV (and they do have that kind of ""cool"" factor with 4WD and/or off-road tires), it *might* be an option. To me, his post screamed mostly of desperation about not having to settle for yet another mid-life jellybean or look like everyone else running around in their yuppie SUVs. A big stomping loud truck might be exactly the sort of ""fun"" he is interested in. Lastly, I mentioned the Jeep because other than being a SUV, it does fit the other criteria. He has to make compromises in all of this. But it's 10K under budget, gets 30mpg, fits the kids, and looks unlike any other SUV out there.(I'd say it looks more like a lifted station wagon like the Volvo XC90 than a SUV) It just might appeal to him as different enough to be worth looking into. It's inexpensive, fun to drive (especially with the manual), and the whole thing has a ""let it get dirty - just hose it off"" aspect to it. Perfect for kids to grow up in without having a stroke about stains and clutter.Hey, Jeeps are cool. If it's a SUV, at *least* get a Jeep. ... Re #2 above....I was thinking this over again, and there is another option worth considering if he can stand a *used* vehicle.- Get a 2009 Pontiac G8. It doesn't get 30mpg. But you won't care. Why? Because it's the best car GM ever made. It has upgraded suspension, great looks, and most of all, is RWD and has the same engine as a Cadillac CTS. The V8 version? It has a Corvette engine in it. It does 0-60 in 5.5 seconds.It's stupidly fast for a GM car and handles like it grew up in another country (which it did, being the best selling car line in Australia). I honestly liked driving it more than the new Cadillac CTS by a small but significant amount. But wow it's a LOT cheaper. Much better visibility as well. Even new, it was 10K less. But used, well, you're looking at well under 20K. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Actually Pletko...from the OP his requirements:Must seat 5 &#150; That is two adults in front and 2 car seats and a booster in back. ( I have twin 3 year olds and a 6 year old) No SUV &#150; I have a minivan so I am looking for a Sedan or Wagon  At least 30 MPG &#150; I commute 26 miles each way to work Under $30K None of your recommendations match these. There are many cars that will fit three car seats....not to mention two and a booster. Granted it will be very tight and most likely a complete PITA......and it also depends on the type of car seats. BUT it can be done and certainly doesn't require a truck...particularly if the person has no desire for a truck/van/suv. Then the wants....good performance, fun to drive...again none of your original recommendations come close. The G8 is a nice try and at least worth mentioning since it hits all but one....but there are obviously other choices that will check ALL the boxes. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

You're simply wrong, Plekto, about SO many things in addition to misreading the OP's criteria. Regarding your beloved Jeep Patriot, here is Consumer Reports summary of it:A small, car-based SUV derived from the Dodge Caliber and mechanically similar to the Jeep Compass, the Patriot remains a mediocre vehicle overall. Handling is unimpressive, and even the up-level engine that comes with all-wheel-drive versions feels sluggish and sounds noisy. The seats are second-rate, and it's hard to find a good driving position. To its credit, the Patriot has an absorbent ride and well-suppressed road noise, and mostly simple controls. But that's not enough to compensate for its flaws. CR also reported overall mileage as 21 mpg. And it's not as wide in the back seat as the Passat. Yeah, it's half the price of the $30K limit the OP suggested, but since it doesn't fit ANY of his criteria, why mention it? ",Posts: 50,Member

OK, First off I want to thank everyone for their suggestions. It was never my intent to start a posting war. :-)I am only interested in a Sedan or Wagon, so SUV&#146;s and Trucks are out of the picture. As far as another minvan, I have a 2011 Toyota sienna. I don&#146;t need another minivan. I just want a car that I can throw all 3 kids into in a pinch (you never know when your car will break down). I mentioned the Camry because I know for a fact that the new one will work as I rented one and two cars seats and a booster fit. It was snug, but it worked. I have considered the Cadillac, and I really like the BMW wagons, but they take premium gas and that is just a deal breaker. So truly, Thank You to all of you for sharing your opinions with me. It is helping me make an informed decision and that is why I posted my question here in the first place. ",Posts: 2,Member

Hope you find what you're looking for. BTW, I looked at how the new Passat has been reviewed and I'm not sure it's going to give you the driving pleasure that I had associated with VWs in the past. Apparently, the newest model has lost some of the crispness of previous generations. So the new Fusion hybrid might be a better candidate. My impression of the Optima is that it's a very nice car but maybe not quite up to the standards that you, as a former 911 owner, might be seeking in terms of responsiveness and steering response. There's the new Accord to check out as well -- the 2008-12 generation lost some edge, but Honda apparently is trying to get it back with this newest iteration. ",Posts: 50,Member

If you've read the reviews on the Fusion, you've noticed it has a fairly tight back seat for the class, plus quality control seems to be an issue.I don't see why the Optima wouldn't be worth a test drive. No 911, but one of the better and roomier mid-sized cars. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I was thinking about sedans and wagons and so on and I remembered one or two more choices that might work, though they won't get 30mpg. (nothing will, really)1 - As I mentioned, a Pontiac G8. You could also go for an Impala, which isn't as good, but it is pretty decent nonetheless. In 2013, GM is bringing back the G8/Holden platform in case you feel like waiting.2 - Any of the Big GM cars. (Buick LaCrosse/Lucerne). I could consistently get 25-27mpg highway in one. GM makes the most fuel-efficient V6 engines and the best automatic transmissions, so while the rest of the car is rather meh, the thing will drive forever. 3 - The Ford Taurus or Flex might also work. The problem is that 30mpg and large is impossible since they started a HP race a decade or so ago. For instance, a 2004 Pontiac GTO got 30mpg highway. Just that one year. Then they changed it completely in 2005 and mpg dropped to 22. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I'm looking for either a 2009 Chevy Malibu or a 2008/2009 Honda Accord. I must have leather seats. From what I've read, it seems that only the LTZ for the Malibu and only the EX-L for the Accord have leather seats, but I can't seem to definitively confirm that.Can someone confirm that all 2008 Malibu LTZ and all 2008/9 Accord EX-L's have leather seats, and that none of the others have leather seats?Thanks!

As far as the Chevy, all LTZ's have leather, but there were LT's with a leather option. It was a different leather than the LTZ. If you're looking at the 4cyl, I'd look for one with the 6-speed transmission. Limited availability during those years and typically only on the higher end models. Regarding the Accord, EX-L (L for leather) obviously but there are times they produce an SE model that also has leather. I'm not sure if they produced that model during '08/'09 or not.

You might also consider a Pontiac G6, since it's basically the same car with a more upscale interior and options (like leather). Also, the Saturn Aura was based on the same platform. Both Pontiac and Saturn have terrible resale values due to the brands being gone, but the engineering and parts are the same. This can represent a lot of potential savings.Also, the GM W platform cars might work as well. * 2004&#150;2008 Pontiac Grand Prix* 2005&#150;2009 Buick LaCrosse* 2006&#150;2013 Chevrolet Impala* 2006&#150;2007 Chevrolet Monte CarloThese also tended to come with leather and more options standard.

My mom is in the market for a new car and (as always) wants my input and assistance in the process. I'm pretty sure that she thinks I'm clairvoyant because she expects me to ""know"" what will appeal to her. To be honest, although I lack supernatural abilities, after spending 38 years trying to figure her out, I have a creepy ability to pick out exactly what she likes 99% of the time. But I would still welcome some outside opinions on my choice of finalists, which are as follows-2011-2012 CPO Nissan Altima 3.5 SR2013 KIA Sorento EX FWD (prefer 2.4L)2013 KIA Optima EX 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport2013 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.4My mom is an interesting character (to say the least) and that definitely extends to her vehicle preference. Vehicle styling/appearance is at the top of her list, with reliability and pricing/value being a close second. For the first time, fuel economy is also a somewhat important factor. She is 58, rarely carries passengers other than my step-dad and/or an occasional grandkid (ages 2 and 6), so a 5-passenger car/SUV is fine. She drives a school bus and her route starts and ends at her driveway, so she never uses a personal vehicle to commute. Her list of 'required' features include heated, leather seats, a decent audio system, power sunroof and that's about it. This will be a vehicle that she keeps for 8-10 years and averages 10-12k miles per year. She currently has a 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer (4.0L, RWD) that has has been nothing but trouble!!! She purchased it from my best friend when it was 16 months old with 70k miles on it (it was his company car). It now has 135k miles on it; in the last 65k miles and 4.5yrs, we've spent almost $5,500 in repairs!!! That does NOT include any regular maintenance or tires/brakes. The transmission has also started having intermittent issues and one side of the power-folding 3rd row seat is stuck in the down position and would cost $580 to repair! Pretty pathetic for a vehicle with a $36k sticker price less than six years ago.Needless to say, we want a reliable/durable vehicle with 100k miles of Powertrain coverage to back it up! The only 'rules' my step-dad has given me is NOTHING from GM/Ford/Chrysler and try to keep it under $30k.The 4-cylinder versions of the KIA and Hyundai vehicles are more than sufficient for her needs and driving style. The reason for considering the Nissan Altima 3.5 SR (which has a 3.5L V6, 270hp and only gets 27mpg highway) has nothing to do with performance....it's all about looks! The 3.5 SR has the beefy 17"" alloy wheels and low-profile tires, rear spoiler and several other sporty exterior tweaks that really make it a great looking car. I prefer the looks of the 2012 model over the new 2013 Altima, plus a 2011-2012 CPO will have the standard 100k Powertrain coverage.Which of the five vehicles listed above would be the best fit based on the information I've given? If you had to choose one of the five to purchase for yourself, which one would it be and why?I look forward to your responses! ",Posts: 801,Member

I don't know where you're getting your information about the Fusion. First, you realize that there's a 2013 model that is a complete redesign, don't you? And that new model has more room in the back than the previous model? And Consumer Reports rates the Fusion's reliability as above average. The only reliability issues were a few areas in the 2010 model. The problems Ford has had with reliability have been with its complicated MyFord system and the transmission on the new Focus.

I would go Altima out of that batch. You already said she likes the looks and honestly they're a very good car particularly with that V6. Performance to back up the good looks. The CVT can have questionable reliability but the warranty should cover you for five years anyway. Remember those warranties are from when placed in service...so 7 years/100k miles CPO on the Nissan is from when it was built. Obviously best to find one as new as possible from a date standpoint when you only drive 10k miles a year. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

CR has not rated the 2013 Fusion for reliability yet. I would expect it would pass on that until there's real world data, since it is a redesign with new powertrains.I've read two different reviews on the Fusion that complained about the relatively tight back seat compared to its competitors. I believe they were C/D and Motor Trend. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Since your mom is interested in fuel economy, and doesn't need the hauling ability of an SUV, I'd strike all the SUVs off the list. The Santa Fe in particular is a new model, so reliability is questionable.Since your mom is OK with the Altima, and also is OK with a 4 cylinder (cf. Optima EX, and Sorento and Santa fe with 2.4L), why not the new 2013 Altima 2.5? Doesn't she like how it looks? It's power is up from 2013 (2.5L) and it has exceptional fuel economy--better than the Optima EX. You said YOU don't like the looks of the 2013 Altima... but how about your mom?If I were her I'd drive ALL the latest mid-sized 4-cylinder cars including the Altima, Accord, Passat, Fusion, Optima, and Sonata before plopping down nearly $30k. (Personally I'd skip the Malibu, but go ahead and drive that too if she wants, it's pretty good looking.) It's fun driving the cars, and then she'll know which one she likes to DRIVE the best. Also she'll know what they look like up close and inside. But cars aren't just for looking at and pumping gas into.P.S. If I had to choose one on the list I'd take the Optima EX, I think it fits your mom's criteria the best of those 5 vehicles. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Is there a reason u left off the 13 Honda Accord? I'd suggest a sedan cuz she drives a huge bus everyday.The Optima is a great choice but it's a above average with road noise. The 13 Fusion is a great car, European styled, and rides like a German Car. The Mytouch Ford Sync is a problem for mature folks cuz of the tiny buttons on the Sync.

I originally planned to include the 2013 Honda Accord on the list. I had the pleasure of spending a weekend driving a 2013 Accord Sport a few weeks ago (my bro-in-law runs the body shop at a Honda dealer and the General Manager lets him take home anything he wants). So he brought the new Accord for me and I really enjoyed it. I hated the a2008-2012 Accord, but the 2013 feels, sounds and looks like a real Honda! BUT my step-dad has currently has a 2006 Accord SE 4-door. He is planning to trade it in on a 2013 Accord in a few months when dealers become more willing to discount them. So that&#146;s dad&#146;s car.I personally love the new Ford Fusion, but after the experience they&#146;ve had with her current 2007 Explorer, my step-dad will never allow a Ford vehicle in their garage again! Their experience with all three of the local Ford dealers in buying and servicing her previous 2004 Explorer and her current nightmare-from-hell 2007 Explorer further sour the idea of buying another Ford, no matter how good it actually may be! The warranty coverage isn&#146;t The 2012 Altima 3.5SR has a sport look and aggressive stance that the 2013 models lack, especially the 2.5SL (and other 2.5 versions). I showed mom the photos just to put the possibility on the table and she shot down the 2013 instantly.The 2013 Fusion and Altima have a 3yr/36k Basic Warranty and 6yr/60k Powertrain Coverage. The CPO Nissan and new KIA/Hyundai models all have 100k of Powertrain Coverage. I have located four 2012 CPO 3.5SR models so far and all are less than 10-months in service and under 15k miles. So they have over six years and 85k miles of coverage provided by the 7yr/100k warranty form original in-service date. A new development today is that the budget has been reduced a bit! My step-dad was/is somehow convinced that mom&#146;s 2007 Explorer is worth $11-12k trade-in and someone will pay that for it! So the $30k budget is actually $18k cash plus whatever the hell we can for the Explorer!? Even though it is in Very Good to Excellent physical condition inside and out, the high mileage and history as a corporate fleet vehicle (even if it was my best friend&#146;s company car) in conjunction with it being 2WD/V6 = $8k trade-in is the best I&#146;m expecting. Which translates to a budget of around $26k, not $30k.I&#146;m sure we could sell the Explorer privately for at least $12k, but knowing that the transmission is acting wonky sometimes and a few other minor issues, I can&#146;t sell it to an individual.at least not without telling them all the details about what has gone wrong, is going wrong and will almost certainly go wrong againand that tends to scare off buyers off and/or kill the selling price! I&#146;d much rather it go to the big Carmax auction far away and hope that it doesn&#146;t end up being sold to some poor soul before it all the problems are repaired. ",Posts: 801,Member

""P.S. If I had to choose one on the list I'd take the Optima EX, I think it fits your mom's criteria the best of those 5 vehicles."" If I was choosing a car for myself from the list, it would be the 2012 Altima 3.5SR- hands down!But I spent some time test driving the Sonata and Santa Fe yesterday and the Optima EX today. Even though I've read all the reviews and raves about the Optima, I still wasn't prepared to be as impressed as I was by the Optima EX! It also amazed me just how differently two cars built on the same platform and sharing the same powertrain can feel. The Sonata Limited is undeniably a very good car with interior materials and design that could pass for an entry-level luxury car. But the Optima feels more like a German car- taught, firm ride without being harsh, quick reflexes, and a more no-nonsense exterior design. If I had to choose one least favorite thing about the Sonata, it would be the design and layout of the dashboard! Conversely, the dashboard design is one of my favorite things about the Optima. It is simpler looking with buttons and controls spaced out a bit more and in more logical arrangement. I also love the way that the center stack is canted toward the driver!If you're wondering why I am test driving these cars on my own first, I'm actually test driving the dealership and sales team. They will probably never know it, but it's more for their benefit than anything!Back in December 1994, mom and I were shopping for a new Jeep Grand Cherokee. She knew that was what she wanted, the colors, option packages, and everything else. It was just a matter of actually finding ones that met her specs then trying to get the best deal at a time when they sold Grand Cherokees as fast as they could build them!We found one at a dealership almost 100 miles away that was exactly what she wanted. They quoted a price on the phone that was good enough to make the drive over there worthwhile, so we went. The moment we walked in the showroom, I had a bad feeling about the place. The salesman who gave the phone quote was off, so we ended up with a sleazy, slicked-back-hair, condescending [non-permissible content removed] instead! He immediately asked why mom had came to buy a car without her husband (he had already checked the wedding ring, I suppose). Her response, verbatim, &#147;Because I&#146;m the one buying the car, not him!&#148;We went for a test drive and he insisted that I sit in the back seat so he could demonstrate all the controls and features up front for her. A few minutes into the test drive, mom gunned it when a traffic light turned green to see how much kick it had off the line. Dude actually scolded her for doing it and said the engine wasn&#146;t broken in and blah, blah.so she floored it and didn&#146;t let off for a good 30 seconds- doing 80mph or so in a 45 zone to show him who was boss in that car!Then he actually said &#147;You need to calm down!&#148; to her and patted her knee with his left hand!!! She locked it down in the middle for four lanes of traffic and went carnival-freak crazy on him screaming for him to get out! Doing what any protective son would do in the situation (and being 19, hot-heated, and 6&#146;2&#148; 230#), I jumped out, opened the passenger door and pulled him out of the car and threw him onto the ground (or road surface, to be particular). I got back in the car and she took off like a bat out of hell going back to the dealership (leaving him a few miles away). She skidded across the lawn of the dealership and almost created a drive-thru right in the front of the showroom! She left the door open, engine running and tore off to find the sales managerand I went to the receptionist desk and called 911! We didn&#146;t wait for the cops, but I didn&#146;t want them to come after us because they reported us for assaulting the salesman and trying to steal the car or some similar nonsense. We never heard another word about.but I learned that it&#146;s best to pre-screen dealerships and select a suitable salesperson (I usually try to find a female or gay male salesperson if possible before some &#145;go-getter&#146; nabs me instead)! It would be a far worse fate for a sleazy perv if it they pulled that crap on her today.

i'm shooting for around 16k for a civic lx 2012 and shooting for prius c two for 19k. the difference i feel like would take about 4 years of driving to make up. i liked how the civic handled. the prius handles ok, but obviously the pick up isn't as nice as the civic.i've never bought a car before, but i'm emergently having to because my old 92 camry died on me (it was at 230k+ and strong! for awhile...)anyone able to share more insight?

Civic and Prius are sort of different cars, although about the same size. If you prize MPG above everything else, then the Prius is the way to go.If you want more of a traditional driving vehicle, with slightly less fuel efficiency, the Civic will serve you well, and for a very long time.That said, I've only been in a Prius once. Like you, I found it painfully slow, and not very comfortable. ","Posts: 13,224",Member

Out of those two choices, Civic all day long. 2013 Civic will be much improved though...the '12 is a bit lacking in the Honda scheme of things. But if you can't wait...you can't wait. I'll throw out one more to look at...Hyundai Elantra. Should be priced about the same as Civic, I'd dare to say it's better, and much longer warranty.  ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I drove an Elantra GLS (2012, with Popular Equipment Package) to NYC from Birmingham, Alabama back in August. Me and three friends road tripped through the App. Mntns to get there. It more than met our needs for space, and we averaged 37 MPG for the entire 2,000 mile trip. One tank topped 41 MPG, but loaded as we were, we were happy with our overall average, especially considering we drove into and out of Manhattan. Yes, the engine dropped to 4th gear up some of the long grades (approx 4,200 RPM at 70MPH) to keep us moving, but it was very relaxed otherwise, running low RPM quietly. The price was similar to the Civic LX, but it had more equipment and interior space.In comparison, the Civic I've driven was much noisier, if similar in the power department. I know you didn't ask about the Elantra, but give it a test drive. It is a substantial feeling car and a good value. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Stumbled on this forum while researching used vehicles and thought I would give it a try as you all seem so knowledgable. I am needing to replace my commuting vehicle, a 1995 Lexus 300, as it is finally getting to the point where fixing anything wrong on it would be more than the car is worth. I live just off a short rural gravel road, but it is paved highway after about 2 miles - lots of hills that can be a problem in the winter. My Lexus conquered them all like the champ he was. I drive about 50 miles per day round trip to work.I have literally not even looked at cars for about ten years, so all the new bells and whistles are a bit much to take in. I tend to drive cars a VERY long time, so reliability and low maintenance are important. I take reasonable care of my vehicles in terms of routine maintenance, but need a mechanic for heavy duty repairs (56 year-young lady).My budget is unfortunately limiting and I realize that. I have between 8-11K to spend on a good used vehicle. My basic needs are:Must be able to transport 4 people of middle age and above - need 4 doors, with not-too cramped back seat and legroom and not too low to climb out of.Open to wagons, sedans, crossovers or suvs that are not too high to get into (5'2""). (Don't like running boards)I like Toyotas and have had a Tercel, a Corolla, a Camry and my Lexus in the last 35 years, but I will consider most any car as they have all improved over the years in terms of reliability.I prefer leather or leatherette seats over cloth for durability, and I love my sunroof but I would give it up if I had to. I know where I am going at all times, so I don't need navigation, and I have never backed into anything so I don't need cameras. (Although after looking at some of the newer cars where the back windows are rapidly shrinking to the size of portholes, I can see why so many cars have backup cameras!) One cup holder per person is a luxury as far as I am concerned, and there are no children that need to be entertained with DVD's or full scale audio systems.I should add that aesthetically I hate the look of the newer boxy things like Scions and Souls.Am I asking the impossible here for the price? All suggestions are greatly appreciated.Forgot to add - I can drive a manual. Don't particularly want to, as it makes holding a cell phone difficult in city traffic, but it's not a deal breaker.

I would certainly recommend a Camry given your history and wants/needs. It will do the job without much complaint and there are examples out there that fall into your price range. It will probably be the newer equal to your 18 year old Lexus. There are tons of rental and lease returns out there...which I would avoid. Find a one-owner that's been cared for and drive it ten years. It might be tight on the budget but I'd try to get in a 2008 or newer. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

In that price range for a used vehicle that fits 4 adults, with great leg room and head room in the back, I have two contenders:1. Hyundai Elantra Touring. Finding one between 8-11k may be a bit tricky, but they are out there. If not the ET, then the prior model Elantra GT hatchback would be my next choice.2. Nissan Versa Hatchback. Much easier to find in this price range.Both cars offer easy entrance/exit for aging adults, great visibility, and a compliant ride. Plus, if you often carry multiple adults as passengers, both offer room in the back to store/haul their items. If you don't need storage room or the versatility of a hatch/wagon, they I agree with the previous poster that an older Camry or Accord would be my third and fourth option for you.

I would ask your dad if he would pay 11-12k for the Explorer.lol.. Full disclosure, I am a Sales Representative. I first want to say the reason many might believe Ford,GM are less reliable is because for years they were the mass producers you will hear about more problems than you would foriegn makes. So if you look at it as a percentage Ford/GM are as reliable as any. Honda, Toyota sales have reached higher levels in the past years and what do you hear about now? Well they have recalls often as well. Now the Explorer is getting a bad wrap here. It was a corporate vehicle. I understand a friend drove it but I promise he didnt not drive it like he owned it. As a salesman I know how important a good service department is. If your is really that bad then I can not think of a good reason to buy a Ford. They have great cars but a good service department is key. I am glad mine is good. I will say I hate selling used vehicles unless it is under 18k miles and a CPO preferably. Ford has a great CPO that adds 2 years and 40k miles of warranty. Chevy has great warranty for new. Honda has great CPO program as well. Good luck. Wish you all well. ",Posts: 42,Member

Here are my top choices:1: Believe it or not, you can get a 2-3 year old *non-rental* Grand Marquis for about your price range. It's big, extremely overbuilt, and parts are extremely inexpensive. Toyota breaks less often but the parts are getting hideously expensive as of late. It's big, comfy, and perfect for a 50 mile highway commute. It's as close to your old Lexus as you'll find in that price range, IMO. The fact that you want a solid and comfortable ride over amenities and frills makes you the perfect buyer for one of these, IMO.And there's tons of glass. You can actually see out the back. And sides. And it's not nearly as hard to park as you'd think, thanks to being rear wheel drive.2: A Buick Park Avenue. This is the last of GM's overbuilt large cars. It's basically a Cadillac DTS with a V6 instead of a V8. This means decent MPG on the highway but the exact same ride and quality - just different body panels for the most part. The downside is that 2005 was the last year. The up-side is an absolute mint condition one can be had for about $7K. Not bad for almost a decade newer than your Lexus.Also, FYI, GM builds the best automatics on the planet, with Ford 2nd. 3: A Honda Accord with manual. Why I mention this be because the 4 cylinder with manual is exactly as fast as the 6 with automatic in actual driving. But it's literally video game simple to shift gears in. The clutch must have all of 10 lbs of spring on it and it appears to just be controlling a set of servos instead of a direct linkage. So simple anyone can learn to drive it. It's also amazingly reliable.4: Going even smaller, a Toyota Rav4 is great. Especially the first generation one with manual. It's quick, has 4WD (plus an actual diff lock) and is extremely fun to drive. The 2nd generation model is also quite nice. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I am definitely torn with this one. I've been researching cars for about 4 months now while I've been working on selling my truck privately. I'm pretty close to the point where I'd be willing to just trade it in, be happy to get what I owe on it, and cut it even. Anyway, after a long 4 months of researching sedans on the Internet, pricing them out, talking to some dealers here and there, I'm still pretty torn between three sedans. The 2011/2012 Hyundai Elantra Limited, the 2012 Mazda3 i Touring, or the 2013 Dodge Dart SXT. For a good month or two I was completely sold on a Mazda3. I hadn't really considered the Hyundai Elantra at all, but I heard that Hyundai was really making a comeback and doing some good things, so I checked it out and I fell in love. Then, I discovered the brand new Dodge Dart, and I fell in love again. The exterior of the Dart is a thing of beauty, and then interior is so clean and it's one of my favorites I've seen. I've only been reading about the Dart for the past day or so, so I definitely don't claim to know everything about it. What I do know though, is I am torn. Now, one of the main things I'm looking for in my vehicle is fuel efficiency. I know the Dart with the 1.4L engine is rated 39 MPG hwy, which is up there with the Mazda3 at 40 MPG hwy, and the Elantra which is also rated at 39 MPG hwy, so in that aspect I consider all 3 of them pretty much a tie. Unless I'm missing something and one of them is rated higher than what it really gets. Another big thing for me is the exterior. I know that's personal taste and the Dart definitely wins that one for me. Interior is another must-have for me. I want the inside to loo just as good as the outside, considering it's what I'm going to be seeing the most. Next point would be how fun it is to drive. And finally, front leg and head room. I'm 6'2"". The only two vehicles I've ever owned and driven on a regular basis is my old 1989 Jeep Wagoneer, and my current 2003 Dodge Ram. Big vehicles. I'm making the switch to a sedan for, well, obvious reasons. My big Ram is killing my wallet. And a midsize sedan is just out of my price range. For the most part, I've researched all of these main focus points for me pretty thoroughly. However if anyone possibly has anything to add, personal experience with any of these vehicles, anything commonly overlooked, and anything like that I would greatly appreciate reading about it. I just need that final nudge towards one of these vehicles to force me to make up my mind and dive in. Thanks guys (and gals)! ",Posts: 7,Member

Have you spent much time driving cars to know you're not going to go crazy making this move? With the exception of my sports cars, I absolutely hate driving a typical car after driving trucks/SUV's for the last 15+ years. I'm not going to recommend any of them but will recommend you find a rental lot and pick up any of these (the Dart may not be on the rental lots yet...but it might be) and spend a few days on your normal commute. You've probably be averaging 15mpg on a good day with the Dodge...and I will say there are quite a few 20-25mpg SUV's you might find more appealing over all. Gas mileage is a big deal...but so is your sanity if you buy something you absolutely hate after a few weeks. And the cost of getting out of a brand new car will likely be prohibitive for you since it sounds like you're stretching yoru budget pretty hard to get into this. And that's another issue I don't recommend at all. Buy a used one and keep some money in the bank (or finance less). ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I'm only 21 so I'd say I've been driving larger vehicles for 5+ years or so. I may take your advice and rent for a few days just to try it out. Or maybe see if I can find a dealer willing to let me test drive it overnight. But either way that'll have to wait for about a month, as I'm currently deployed right now. Although whenever I go home on leave I drive my mom's 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix or my fiancee's 2005 Dodge Stratus, as I have to leave my truck on the other side of the country. So, I do drive cars every now and then. It is most certainly odd driving one when I've been driving my truck for a few months, but I go back and forth so much I could get used to either one. But once I get used to being so low to the ground and not being able to see as much, I can get into driving them and enjoy the extra peppiness that comes with not driving a full-size truck. However, don't get me wrong, I still dream of getting myself a nice Ford F-150 here in 10 years or so.  ",Posts: 7,Member

The Elantra has recently been down-rated. The 40 MPG for it turned out to be ""testing error"" or something. I'd skip it for now. The Dart will get EPA, and is a torque-rich motor (that's a good thing), but that 1.4L wants premium, so factor that in. I don't know how the Dart does, but I know the Mazda3 actually gets its EPA rating or better in real life. They're both pretty fun to drive.If you want to still maintain some cargo capacity, the Mazda3 is available as a hatchback. The Dart's got a lot more gadgets though. ","Posts: 2,743",Member

I haven't driven the Dart but have checked it out. I like the exterior but the interior was not as impressive. Maybe in the higher trim with leather it would be. Also the back seat was surprisingly tight for such a large car... the Elantra has more room.If I had to choose between these 3 I'd go with the Mazda3. Great handling, buttoned-down ride, excellent fuel economy, reliable. Who knows how reliable the Dart will be? The Elantra is good looking and roomy, and pretty economical, but not the crisp handling of the Mazda3.Also at least in my area it's possible to get a 2012 Mazda3 Touring sedan for about $16,500. Great deal on that car. I'd go for the hatch myself though. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

IMO, a better choice for about the same money would be to get a basic Ford Mustang. With the V6, it gets 30 highway and is quite a bit more usable than the Dart. Also, a whole lot faster as well.See, by the time you option out the Dart, you're pushing $18-19K, and it's not really much different than a basic V6 mustang in terms of features. Also, in terms of reliability, I'd put my money on Ford over Dodge. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Actually, Truecar has a Dart at around $18K by the time you get the SXT version, which you have to TO GET AIR CONDITIONING FROM THE BUMS. The Base model is a total stripper that even rental companies won't want to buy as it is below their minimum equipment requirements. I mean, who actually makes you pay for air conditioning and floor mats these days? What is this, 1990?So you have to start with at least the SXT for $18K. Plus another $1100 for an automatic if you want that. And to add insult to it all, it's not the 40mpg highway turbo model. It gets 24/34 with the automatic, or a whopping 5mpg better than, well, a typical V6 sedan.$19,540 was the price I got locally via truecar including destination charge. For a Dart with just A/C and automatic. Zero other options. Add in decent paint or better sound or anything else and you just hit $20K.If he wants high MPG, it's $20K plus automatic, or $21K. The idea of a $16K car to run around in was left in the dust a long long time ago. Remember, that a base model Prius, which has all of this standard as well is $23K. And it actually DOES get 40mpg. The second you hit 20K, you're faced with alternatives that crush the econoboxes flat. 20K for a Dart vs 23K for a Prius? He will save $500 a year in fuel with the Prius, guaranteed. And have a lot less depreciation than in a Dodge.I keep bringing the Mustang up because it's a good vehicle and a stunning deal for the money. 300HP and 30mpg highway? That's got to be worth something in the calculation as well. Whenever I see econoboxes creeping towards 20K, I recommend it as it comes with all that stuff standard, is better built, and that 300HP engine is (IMO at least) well worth the extra thousand dollars. When I recommend cars, I ignore the number of doors first, since it's really an aesthetics thing and very low on most people's list of must-haves, generally. 2 vs 3 vs 4 vs 5 doors is usually a ""whatever"" if push comes to shove. A lot of people can manage to live with a 2 door car if it's just hauling around the occasional friend or maybe fitting a child seat back there. I also largely ignore MPG if the poster is asking for the impossible. 40mpg means a TDI engine or a hybrid. Anything else in real-world driving won't get better than about 30mpg combined. LOT of cars get 25 combined or so, though. Like a bog standard 4 cylinder Camry. Or 3/4 of everything GM makes aside from its trucks. Anything that does get 40mpg highway, though, is well over 20K. Every last one of them charges you a small fortune for that MPG gain, be it a hybrid or a super economy engine.Unless he drives 50K a year, 5mpg isn't worth having to settle for a tin can on wheels. Which is kind of what the Dart is unfortunately turning out to be. It's nice, but it's just not worth $19K.*****Now, if he wants a simple thing to get around in and needs 4 doors, for 16K or less, he might consider a Jeep Patriot. It's really a small wagon that's been lifted 3 inches. I consider it a wagon and not a SUV in any case. Jeep does as well, considering that it has a ""brother"" version which is the Compass. Unibody construction as well. Not a truck by any stretch of the imagination.That said, it does drive well. It's dirt cheap. It hauls a lot. 23/30 isn't so bad, either. So why consider one?http://www.truecar.com/prices-new/jeep/patriot-pricing/2012/$14K. It's the price of a Yaris for the base model. Add in a few options, air conditioning, and you're still just under $16K. And that's the OP's real price goal. The only real down-side is that you must get the manual. It's a good manual as well - easy to drive. But it will save you a fortune later on as the CVT is a hateful thing that's expensive to fix - just avoid it and get the manual. It's the least expensive new vehicle that I know of that's worth considering. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

He was looking for 40 MPG highway, which is perfectly attainable in a non-TDI, non-hybrid. Your excuses are very thin here.

I'll give you the AC comment...there's only a few vehicles that don't come with AC these days (Civic DX for one....) but floor mats are becoming more common as an option. In theory I would put it as a plus because I always end up with all-season mats anyway. In fact, I was just tripping over 2 sets of new OEM carpeted floor mats piled up in the garage. The catch of course is that the dealers order them on all the models so you get stuck with them anyway. Mustang is no doubt a nice car for the money. But you're likely going to take a 10mpg hit over an economy car and even for someone driving 15k a year, that can add up. $50/month in fuel is a lot if someone really doesn't need something like that. I'm dropping an extra $200/month on fuel driving my Pathfinder vs a car...but I don't like cars! ","Posts: 3,241",Member

The 40mpg Dart is 21K with just the Automatic transmission added and no other options.The Chevy Cruse Eco is $22KThe Prius is $23K.The Mazda 3 i sport which does get 40mpg (all other models are not even close to 40mpg) is $19,600. If you can find one with no other options, that is. I guess $19,600 *is* technically under $20K...A VW TDI is close to 25K. Ouch.40mpg and under $20K is almost* impossible. So I generally ignore it and look at other factors. 30 or even 35mpg highway, though, is quite easy to do on the other hand. * There is one and only one option legitimately under 20K. And that's the Honda Insight. It's $19,200 including delivery charge. It comes with everything standard. I don't mention it most of the time, though, as it is frankly a rather nasty car to actually drive. No power, paper thin interior that's just to look at, and hopelessly budget everywhere you look at it. Add in a nasty CVT that's brain-dead, and the angst is complete.For the price, considering it's a Honda and a hybrid, it's a great deal. But it's also such a let-down as well in so many ways. They tried to get good MPG out of it and they did. But they also sucked all of the goodies and soul out of it as well in order to get every save ounce of weight. To me, it feels like a 4 door wagon version of a Smart Car. It's lovely to look at but it actually makes me want a Prius more. And that kind of kills my soul a bit, just thinking about how a car actually is so austere and eco-maniac that it makes me think about a Prius.Who knows? The OP might fall in love with the Insight. Me? Life's too short to drive a hybrid. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

For one, in no way, shape, or form do I want a hybrid. Much less a Prius... blegh. Am I willing to sacrifice a little fuel efficiency for more power and fun factor? Definitely. I would possibly consider a Mustang if I got behind the wheel of one and got that rush from driving it, I'm sure you all know exactly what I'm talking about. Hell, what I drive now gets 12 mpg combined, so anything in the 30 range I will be perfectly happy with haha. I was considering the Dart for the extra fun factor that it might have given the engine and all the praise the 6-speed manual is getting, but from the looks of things and testimonies of people who have gotten to drive one, the Mazda3 still takes that cake. I am certain this decision will come down to a good amount of test driving and letting my heart decide from there. The only thing is I have to wait a month to return from this damn deployment, so I was at least trying to get it narrowed down to a few cars. If there's one thing I'm absolutely sure of it's that I do NOT want a stinking Prius, or ANY hybrid for that matter. I want to feel alive driving it, not feel like the engine is about to rip out if I put a little foot in it. If that means sacrificing a little fuel efficiency, so be it. I'd really rather not drop below 30 mpg hwy though, if I can help it. ",Posts: 7,Member

Mustang is no doubt a nice car for the money. But you're likely going to take a 10mpg hit over an economy car and even for someone driving 15k a year, that can add up.I usually try to compress multiple responses, but I thought a little math would be informative. Not anything personal, mind, you, but because there are so many lurkers who are obsessed with MPG.15K miles times 3.50 a gallon (national average is a bit lower, but this makes the math easier). 32 mpg combined car (40mpg highway Dart) is 469 gallons. 25 mpg combined car (30mpg highway) is 600 gallons. That's about $450 a year in extra fuel, or about $38 a month.Q: is it worth $38 a month to drive a car with no power, no features, and that costs a 2-3K premium over a standard car (say a Honda Fit for $17K)? I personally don't think it's (normally) good economics to chase MPG at the expense of everything else. Because a Honda Fit (as an example) is about 3K less than the 40MPG cars. With a combined 29mpg, that Fit vs a Dart or Mazda 3 can end up being ten years to make up the difference. (note - it's a never break even scenario with VW and some hybrids)Note - a Honda Fit is also a nice choice for him. The low weight actually makes it fun to toss around. I forgot about it for some strange reason.  ","Posts: 3,738",Member

A Honda Fit is out of the question, personally I am not a fan of that type of styling whatsoever. A Mustang honestly would be pretty nice, the fun factor would make up for what I'd be losing mpg-wise, but it's a little out of my price range. 18.5K MAX is what I can realistically afford. Mazda is having some really good sales right now, and I've gotten numerous quotes for a brand new Mazda3 i Touring for sub-17K, which I'm sure I could get even lower with USAA discounts and military discounts. This is a great deal, and depending on what else is out there by the time I get back I may jump on it. Most everyone has recommended it anyway, saying it's a lot of fun to drive while still getting very good mpg. Another car I just stumbled upon though is the new 2013 Nissan Sentra, though I can't quite decide if I'm a fan of the styling. The SV is sub-18K MSRP, so I'm sure I could cut a deal around the 17K mark, and its mpg is rated pretty much identical to the Mazda3, only not as much horsepower which would be the only concern for me. If it's not as fun to drive as the Mazda3, I will probably pass it up. All in all it's looking like it will come down to the test driving these cars. ",Posts: 7,Member

I've driven the 2013 Sentra. If you are looking for a nice small car appliance that has no power, imprecise handling, and good fuel economy, also a nice interior for its price, you might want to check it out. Good little car to schlep from point A to point B.But based on what you said here I think you'll find the Mazda3 much more to your liking. It also gets very good fuel economy. But you'll actually have fun driving it. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Thank you a lot for your input! I feel as if I've definitely made up my mind at this point. I can't wait to test drive a Mazda3 for myself. How does the driver's seat fare with taller drivers though?

A Cruze is ""far superior"" to a Mazda3? A Hyundai Elantra? C'mon. Decent car I'm sure, but not ""far superior.""And let's stop all the ""Mustangs get 30 mpg"" nonsense. Look at a Mustang owners forum. The guys posting there say they're averaging 20-22 mpg combined city/highway. Some are thrilled to hit 24, in highway-only driving. A lot say they're getting 16-18 mpg in typical driving. You'd have to believe in fairies to think a heavy car with a 300-plus engine is going to get 30 mpg, and if you try to baby it to squeeze out an extra mpg or 2, you'll lose all the fun.One downside to the new Mazda3: The new, fuel-efficient engine is supposed to be a bit of a dog compared to previous versions.

One downside to the new Mazda3: The new, fuel-efficient engine is supposed to be a bit of a dog compared to previous versions.....and, it is a two seater; it is time to get over that too. I simply would never buy a car that cannot fit two adults in the back. Some of these manufacturers aught to just skip the back seat altogether and have a flat floor for hauling/loading. As in the case with the Mazda 3, and many versions of Subarus, the designers seem more intent on providing room for an umbrella than thoughtfully planning out adequate space for adults. If I want a two seater, I'll get a Miata. Please don't continue to charge me 20+ thousand dollars for a car with little/no useful space behind the driver's seat! ","Posts: 1,340",Member

I would think if hauling adults comfortably is a need....you would just buy a more appropriately sized car to begin with. I used to commute in a VW Jetta diesel that allowed the front seat to go back so far it rendered the back seat useless. That was fine by me because it was one of the few small cars I was extremely comfortable driving (i'm 6'4). I find many much larger cars to limit the travel of the front seat to a point I don't have enough room. It's been awhile but I had a Mazda3 rental and don't recall having any issues. One of the worst in recent years was a Pontiac G6 which is bigger than a Mazda3 but was not comfortable at all. I also don't find the Impala all that comfortable and that's probably considered a full size today. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

The Reason I think the Cruze is a better car than the 3 is because it actually has a usable and decent interior. It certainly drives better thanks to the weight and wheelbase. Almost all of the magazines seem to be calling neck and neck between the two. Remember, that this car is a re-badged version of GM's best selling small car in Europe and is made by Opel. So it feels a lot better than the GM of old. Or essentially it's caught up with the imports.But $16K? (including the destination fee!) That's 2-3K less than the nearly identical driving 3. Plus it has a usable rear seat. I have to give the Cruse the win here based on that crazy incentive program. And 0% for 5 years financing.Also note that according to the EPA, the Cruze is actually a mid-size sedan and GM is marketing it as a compact. Where it is doing very well as expected. Of course the heavier and beefier built chassis will drive smoother. Of course the rear seat can fit normal people. The trunk in the Cruze is almost 50% larger than the 3 as well.If the prices were the same, I'd probably get the Mazda. But at 16k? Grab it while there are still some 2012s left on dealer lots.

What a joke... more cramped for leg room than even the Mazda3. One of the main reasons I took it off my list a long time ago.I will say the dash is pretty nice on the Cruze. And the car has a nice solid feel. But so too does the Mazda3.And the Cruze has no steering feel. A problem the Mazda3 does NOT have.Leftover Mazda3i Touring sedans can be had for $16.5k in my town. I'd take that any day over a Cruze LS. Does that even offer cruise? I don't think so. (kinda funny... no cruise on the Cruze). And not the turbo 4 either, on that LS.

Same here. I've received multiple quotes for about 16.5K on i Touring 3's, AFTER destination fee and BEFORE military rebates (which I believe is only $500, but still, that's 16K which in my opinion is an INCREDIBLE deal). With that, I'm sold. No need to sacrifice options or anything. That's the price of most BASE models of cars in the same class with half the options. I believe the only way my mind can change is if the offer isn't available in a month, which I don't believe will happen because dealers will still be trying to clear the 2012s off the lot, and I know end of December sales can be very rewarding, possibly even more than November.Not to mention, sure I can get a Cruze at the same price, but that's a stripped down Cruze with no options, not even cruise control! No thanks. I'll stick with a 3 i Touring, which mind you is the second most option-happy trim the 3 comes in, second to the i Grand Touring (unless you count the s Touring and Grand Touring models, which I don't because of the mpg hit for only a little more horses) which comes with leather and a few other bells and whistles, which I wouldn't call a necessity by any means.

My fiance and I need a second car. We have a 2001 Toyota Camry with about 110k miles right now. It has no major issues but we want a second car so we aren't sharing.It needs good gas mileage, so we're leaning toward another mid-size sedan. It will mostly be used by one of us to get to work 5 days a week, so we don't want to spend a ton on gas.We want something reliable. I've owned that Camry and a Honda Accord in the past, both purchased with high miles because I knew they would last long and be reliable. I'm open to any suggestions but my instincts say it should either have low miles or be a model that is well-known for reliability.We also want it to be able to handle driving to the mountains for snowboarding. We're from Michigan so we're used to driving in snow, but now we're living in Seattle so we'd be taking it to the mountains (we'll also need some tire chains). It would also be nice if the trunk was wide enough to fit a 156cm long snowboard, like my Toyota can now, but as long as there is some way to fit the boards in back seat or something that is fine. I thought AWD would be nice, but I'm thinking that the cost of reduced fuel efficiency isn't worth it for the weekend trips to the mountains. From what I've heard it isn't that important anyway.Our budget is $10k, but I'd like to keep it closer to $8k.Ideally this will last us about 5 years and hold up a decent portion of its value in that time with regular maintenance.Just looking for some ideas as to what to look out for in our search. Some make/model/year suggestions in that budget would be extremely helpful. Thanks! ",Posts: 3,Member

At that price range, I'd suggest a Pontiac Vibe AWD or Toyota Matrix AWD. I'm not sure what you will find in a Subaru at that price range, but if you can, one of their hatches or wagons would also suite your driving and storage needs. ","Posts: 1,340",Member

Since you seem to like the Toyota/Honda offerings, there's no reason not to look at a newer model of either. Frankly, I think the Camry that would fit into your budget is a dud and would recommend the Accord from 2004-2006. These should fit into your budget with careful shopping and are a much nicer vehicle than similar years Camry. I also would not recommend awd for your location and how often you expect to need it. Snow tires would be a far better investment and would actually help out a lot in rainy Seattle at well. Not only does the AWD requirement narrow your choices down drastically, the mpg is not impressive nor the performance. I'd take a FWD with snow tires over an AWD car with all-seasons any day. You may still need to chain up in the mountains depending on the local laws, but that's not a big deal really. There are certainly other vehicles out there to pick from but you didn't give any other requirements beyond reliability and fuel mileage...and I thing Toyota and Honda have it wrapped up in this price range. There are more interesting or better performing or better looking vehicles...but Accord and Camry are just so plentiful and generally reliable I can't see much argument for anything better.

I second the vote for an Accord, but I'd further refine that choice by noting that not all of the models had side curtain airbags until 2005. That's a big safety advantage. There are many, many Accords out there, and you should be selective when shopping. Because of their durability, you would do well to look for a model with high miles and a careful owner who did the maintenance required. Don't be afraid to get one with 150,000 miles -- you might need to accept that level to get into the sub-$10,000 range. Avoid the V6 because of mileage concerns as well as the need to replace its timing belt every 100,000. Early Accords from that series (2003-2007) had auto transmission problems, so research that, too.Regarding the Matrix/Vibe, drive one after you've driven an Accord. I don't think you'll like it much. Rough ride, noisy, not a lot of fun. Reliable and practical in terms of their shape, sure, but when I had to drive one as a rental years ago I couldn't wait to give it back. ",Posts: 50,Member

Thanks, I'll look into that! (still open to other suggestions too)Quick question, I've always just had all-season tires in Michigan. If I got winter tires in Seattle, would I have to change them in the summer? I'm not sure how much of a hassle this would end up being living in an apartment with limited storage space. Or would they work okay year-round because it doesn't get too hot? I'm guessing that even though the climate is pretty moderate, it would be warm enough in the summer that the winter tires would wear down faster. ",Posts: 3,Member

There are certain snow tires that you could run year round. You end up with an all-season with better than average snow traction...but obviously not as good as a true snow/ice tread. I used to run Nokian WR's on a VW Jetta diesel and they were great in the snow/ice/wet and even on warm days drove really quite nice. I was putting about 50k a year on that car and got two winters out of them plus drove them through a summer to burn them all the way down. They weren't as amazing as Blizzaks...but didn't handle as poorly or wear out as quick. So it's always somewhat of a compromise. The other option is to find a tire shop that will store your winter/summer tires for you. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

The 2008 model was the first year of what's known as the 8th generation of the Accord (2008-12). Given the complexity of designing and manufacturing a car, there are issues that often aren't discovered until the new design has been produced, sold and driven extensively enough for those issues to emerge. This was a known phenomenon among American manufacturers for decades, but the Japanese quality control systems seemed to have been sufficiently robust to avoid the issue in years past. The 2008 Accord was, from my understanding, proof that even Honda can suffer from the first-year-is-the-worst-year malady. It's probably best just to avoid 2008s and look for 2005-07s that meet your requirements. By 2007, Honda had four years of experience with that (7th-generation) design, which was new in 2003. Many Accord fans prefer the 7th generation to the 8th generation for other reasons as well. ",Posts: 50,Member

Exactly why I left the '08+ off my list. Bigger, heavier, less performance/economy and too much cost trimming (aka chintzy bits) for the 8th gen. The 7th gen had a nice feel to it and my experience is there really weren't any major problems on the 4cyl models. I have a friend that is a service manager for a Honda dealer. On the side, he buys these with 150k-200k miles, goes through them to make sure they're serviced and takes care of any needed repairs. He has a waiting list of buyers.... ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Not sure the Accord would be a fit for your board. Did they even have split folding rear seats? -- The Vibe/Matrix may be boring but they definitely have a ton of room, get good fuel economy, do well in bad weather with all season tires. What I'm not sure of is if they have the oomph for mountain driving. I have one but I live in Ohio where it's fairly flat or just hilly. An older Subaru Impreza hatch or even the Legacy wagon might be good. Fuel economy isn't horrible and they are quite reliable and dependable. I saw a lot of them in Oregon.

The Accord has a back seat that folds down. If you're just carrying snowboards, a sedan with a folding seat is plenty sufficient. I don't think I'd go the AWD route if you're trying to save gas. I've lived in the Northwest and AWD isn't really necessary. ",Posts: 50,Member

Only problem with the Protege5 and Mazda3 is that they're not particularly safe. Check the results of the Highway Loss Data Institute/ Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

I'd give a 2005 Rav4 a serious look as well. It's basically a small car/hatchback that's been lifted and has 4WD added. It'll do very well in snow, though, as they can be had with a locking diff, which makes it good for actual bad roads and snow as opposed to something to get you out of your driveway in the morning (as most AWD systems tend to be, especially in older vehicles in your price range)It can also be had with 4 cylinder and manual, which gives it pretty good MPG. (19/25 - new EPA ratings) I had a co-worker who had one and he said he would consistently get closer to 30mpg highway if he kept a light foot on the gas.Most AWD vehicles are lucky if they can get 18mpg by comparison, as they are all saddled with a V6 and a huge amount more weight.

Indeed it wouldn't make sense if a used Mazda3 cost $4,000 less than an equivalent Honda Accord, but in fact it only cost about $400 less. I just ran the numbers on Edmunds' TMV calculator. Similarly equipped, 2005 models, identical mileage (85,000), condition, color and location: Mazda3 dealer price is $7,898. Honda Accord is $8,320. They're both good cars, and the market recognizes that fact and prices accordingly. With so much information available so readily these days, I don't think there are a lot of wildly overpriced or underpriced cars anymore. Years ago, in comparison, not that many people realized that a Geo Prizm and a Toyota Corolla were the same car with different badges. The Geo became a used-car bargain because of it. The same situation is in place today with the Pontiac Vibe and the Toyota Matrix. But people KNOW they're the same car and Edmunds' TMV numbers reflect it. Price them out and equivalent models are within about $100 of each other. ",Posts: 50,Member

Similar Accord LXs seem to be made of gold and average more in the $6k range. So about a 50% difference.TMV isn't exactly reliable. A 2005 Accord LX sedan is right around $7k at the block.

What you have, essentially, is a cost-of-ownership math problem. Keep in mind that you'll likely need to replace some parts -- tires, if nothing else -- during the 45,000 or so miles you'll own the car. In terms of depreciation, the older the car when you buy it the more depreciation has already been factored into the price, which means you'll take less of a hit when you resell it. Because Camrys are both plentiful and reliable, I'm not sure you need to take a pre-owned, certified car from a Toyota dealer. You're paying a premium for that certification and you're restricting the number of cars to consider. It's a bit trickier to do, but if you could find a mechanic who would recommend someone's, say, 5-year-old Camry that you could get for $11,000 you could budget a bit for replacement parts and end up selling it in three years with much less of a drop in price than a $16,000 certified model. Either way would be fine, but the route I've laid out may be the cheapest on the basis of dollar-per-mile. ",Posts: 50,Member

Agree with this... ""certified"" only means that it has an extended warranty.. I woudn't restrict your search to just those.... Go another year older, un-certified, and save $3K-$4K... ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

Well, there's a little more to it than an extended warranty...The Toyota Certified Used Vehicles Advantage:* 12-month/12,000-mile Limited Comprehensive Warranty 1* 7-year/100,000-mile Limited Powertrain Warranty 2* 1-year of Roadside Assistance 3* 160-Point Quality Assurance Inspection* CARFAX® Vehicle History Report&#153; 4* Certified customers are eligible for standard new car financing rates(for details on footnotes, see http://www.toyotacertified.com/)Probably the biggest things beyond the long powertrain warranty are the 160-point inspection and, maybe for some buyers, the new car financing rates (although I can get that from my local bank, so maybe not a big deal).FWIW, I think you'll need to go more than a year older and un-certified to save $3-4k. I searched ALL used Camrys from 2009-up and under $16k and found very little difference in price on certified vs. non-certified, for cars at dealers. You can save a little more buying from a private party, but then better have a mechanic check it out thoroughly and buy the CarFax... and there's time/hassle/cost involved there.You can get a low-miles certified Camry for around $15k or less. That fits the OP's budget. Less risk with the warranty, also in my experience used cars from dealers are preferable to those from private parties because it's really like getting a new car, in terms of condition. The last few used cars I've purchased at dealers were 3-9 years old and except for the odometer reading it was hard to tell them from new. Might not be important to some people... I liked the new-car appearance along with the savings. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If you find one that's still within the original warranty, you can add a Toyota warranty for ~$1,000 and it will be better than the certified warranty. We recently traded our 2011 Sienna Ltd with 30k miles and we contemplated keeping it and addding a warranty (it had a lot of issues). I found a Toyota dealer online selling Toyota Platinum $0 deductible 7 year/125k bumper-to-bumper and it was right around $1,100. 5 year/100k miles was only around $600. I'm assuming the warranty on a $45k Sienna with every option would be more than a Camry...but perhaps that pricing is the same for all models. Either way I think that option is a much better value than certified. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Yeah, if you can get 7 year b-to-b for $1100 on a 2-year-old car that would be great. But... can that be added to a 2nd-hand vehicle? If so, I would think there would be almost no market for Certified cars, if a long b-to-b warranty is that inexpensive.Or get a 2-year-old mid-sized car with 15k miles that already has a 5-year b-to-b warranty on it, then no extra cost for warranty for the time the OP expects to own the car.

Ownership or how the car was acquired is not an issue...it just has to be within the original factory warranty (3/36k). Certified is basically a really good marketing program. Dealers have to pay to participate (and pay for the certification process on each vehicle) but people seem more than willing to pay extra for them! The Toyota extended warranties are also transferable so it can be an incentive when you go to sell. I normally never buy an ext warranty though, odds are in the favor of the warranty company....otherwise they wouldn't be making money selilng them! ","Posts: 3,241",Member

GM makes the most reliable automatic transmissions. The problem is that almost all of their cars are about as interesting as paste from that era. Are you willing to consider other options like a coupe, roadster, or a small SUV? It would greatly increase the number of cars on your list.Myself, I'd spend $6K on a classic car instead, but that's because $6K and less often buys you something that eats a lot of cash over time in repairs and doesn't give you a penny back as it still depreciates to nearly nothing in a few years. At least a classic car (or future classic) holds its value a bit and it's like everyone else's jellybean. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

ah, this is an easy one. Pontiac Vibe; hands down. I found over a hundred of them out there for sale under $6,000. For the money, you are getting a Toyota Corolla (engine, tranny, and most components) and a very reliable car. I have owned both generations. When you do your search, you will (no doubt) incur a pretty high mileage vehicle for sale. No matter. The Corolla engine is good for 200,000 miles or more. The only issues you will have on such a vehicle is:- burns oil at a higher than normal rate (typical of all Corolla engines)- the radio was a GM piece of junk which Toyota replaced in their 2006 and later Matrix models)- paint chipsThat is about all the negative I can come up with. Great car. And to give you a bonus suggestion, the Toyota Matrix is the same vehicle, so now you have two models to search against. Don't waste your money with a civic or corolla sedan when you can have the versatility of a roomy wagon to haul things in too. ","Posts: 1,340",Member

I've owned both a 2001 Elantra (sedan) and 2004 Elantra (GT, hatch). My sister now owns the 2001 and it's held up pretty well, but has needed some parts replaced as it's aged. The 2004 has about 80k miles on it now, is in its 9th Minnesota winter (almost always parked outdoors) and it's been great as far as reliability. Brakes have been replaced once, I put in a new stereo ($100) a few years ago as I never liked the OEM unit, and I've replaced the headlight bulbs a couple of times (all but one replaced under warranty). You should be able to find a 2004 Elantra for ~6000 in good shape, although KBB on mine is nearly ~7000 now because of relatively low miles and excellent condition. (And I only paid $13,200 for it, loaded with leather, moonroof etc. Pretty low depreciation for a nearly 9 year old car!) ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Take Backy's advice with a little grain of salt, though, as he's known on this site for recommending almost nothing but Hyundai cars. The problem with Hyundai cars is that they are not any more reliable than your average cheap import once they start to get around 8-10 years old. This presents a major problem as repairs on any older econobox can start to add up quickly (say, 120K+ miles). Cheap initial price means cheaper, well, everything. From the wheels to the paint to the knobs and switches. Let alone options and safety features. But it's common sense that a $15K car won't be built as well as a $25K car.Your best bet is a semi-luxury model as they are built better and last longer in general. IE - A Buick/Cadillac, Lincoln, Acura, Lexus, and so on. Avoid German and upper-end luxury makes and models unless they have a manual transmission and no sunroof or extra electronic goodies. A good example of a fine choice would be something like a Lexus GS300. It's overbuilt but it is larger, safer, and if driven lightly, should last for many miles without much breaking.Another good choice would be something overbuilt like a Grand Marquis. Now, you could probably find a 2005 for that much money. Sure, it gets 18mpg, but it's indestructible and parts are dirt cheap. A Buick Park Avenue is essentially the same, just GM's version. Just be sure to get one that was never a fleet/rental/police/etc car, whatever you purchase. Yes, these cars are rather large, but they are also much safer and have a better ride. Just something to think about. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Take Backy's advice with a little grain of salt, though, as he's known on this site for recommending almost nothing but Hyundai cars.Absolutely not true and you know it. But it so happens I have actually owned Hyundais, unlike some people here who have no ownership experience but still think they are experts in the cars.For example, everything you said in your post is inaccurate.* Paint on all Hyundais I've owned, including the one that's 12 years old and now with my sister, has held up very well. On my 2004, the paint still shines like new albeit has some surface scratches and a few dings from parking lots.* Knobs/switches are as good as on any car I've owned. I always loved how smooth and damped the HVAC controls on the 2004 Elantra are--even have rubber rings around them for easy gripping. FWIW, the cruise control used on my 2001 Elantra is exactly the same as the one used on many Toyotas for many years--and still used even though almost every other manufacturer has switched to on-wheel controls instead of a stalk.* Hyundai led the industry in use of safety features like side airbags, ABS, and ESC. Even the 2001 Elantra has side airbags standard--how many 2001 compacts had those? My 2004 has ABS with traction control--how many 2004 compacts had that?No, an economy car like the Elantra is not the same quality as a luxury car like the Lexus GS300. But no other economy car is either. See what kind of GS300 you can buy for ~6000. That's what the OP asked for recommendations on... not luxury cars like the GS300. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

It's also worth noting that many luxury vehicles have higher maintenance costs. For example, on my previous Infiniti, rotors had to be replaced when brake pads were replaced, and a rear lighting assembly was $600 in parts alone. Tires for that vehicle were also a lot more costly than the ones I just put on my Escape. These are factors worth checking into before buying a ""luxury"" vehicle.Also, a larger sedan is - obviously - not going to have anywhere near the fuel economy of the smaller sedans mentioned by the OP.

Totally agree...one has to keep the increased costs in mind when going the lux route. There's also the ""piece of mind"" factor as I call it. The piece of mind of knowing that your car will just do what it has to do when it's needed...that with minimal upkeep, it will not leave you stranded. What good is a nice lux vehicle if it's not dependable, if one can't trust it to be consistent and not leave you on the side of the road. To me, this is a very important factor when considering any car.

Well, these aren't really ""luxury"" vehicles. What you are targeting is ""Old retired upper-middle-class professional"". People who take care of their cars, drive them maybe 5-8K a year, and tend to buy larger and more solidly built machines rather than econoboxes. Ie - a Buick or a base model Lexus (or say, since Toyota in Japan is one brand and Lexus is their U.S. ""luxury"" marketing scheme), a Toyota Avalon. As for parts, you go aftermarket and DIY. Most of these cars have plenty of space to work on them for minor fixes and are straightforward for any local mechanic to handle.(case in point, dealer parts for my previous 20 year old Toyota a 4Runner: ~400 for a starter. $120 from the local parts store.) I've had terrible luck in the past with trying to buy cars in the 10-12 year old range at that price point. The cheaper cars have cheaper electricals, wiring, smaller alternators, cheaper gaskets and seals, and so on - all of the little annoying crap that falls apart as any vehicle ages. So while that 2000 Corolla might still run nearly brand new, it's almost guaranteed to have a ratty and nasty interior with tons of little things wrong with it. Such are cheap cars when they get old.I mentioned the Grand Marquis because it depreciates like a rock as 95%+ of the Crown Victoria (brother model) were sold as police cars and rentals and so on. But about half of of these were bought (in small numbers) by elderly people and hardly even used. Add in leather, wood trim, and a few other nice touches, which immediately dissolves any image of it being an ex-taxi or cop car, and it's a wise choice for the person who wants a car on a limited budget.Plus, it's possible to get one in your price range that's only 7 or 8 years old. This gives you a few more years before the age-related items start to go on you.http://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=333103158- -  - This is a typical example. Haggle a bit and you'd be just a little bit above your maximum budget. Not bad for a 7 year old car. Dark red, light blue, and dark blue are the only three colors to consider as they don't give off that ""fleet car"" look. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Trust me, to someone like me who has driven small econo cars since 1976, they are lux cars! In the past few months I've been testing different makes and models for when the wife's Mazda3s is ready to go and one car I was very impressed with was the new Buick Verano...very upscale interior and just a bit larger than what we both drive now...I could very well get used to it for my dd. I'd kill for a C Class or a 3 Series but it's really overkill for my stage in life...retired empty nester who has driven less than 800 miles in over two years...the wife usually drive when we go out. At the rate I'm going, my '06 Civic will still be under 50k when it reaches its 10 mark in our fleet. Just makes sense for me to keep it.Something tells me that my next car will be my last but I wouldn't mind the Verano when that time comes...and it's the only American car that I'd consider at this point. I was that impressed with it and the seats were incredibly comfortable. The only drawback I found was the view out back...not as clear as I'd like but something I could live with.

The Verano that I saw (well, all of them actually at one dealer) all had fit and finish issues that suggested that the employees on the assembly line are doing very poor quality control. Lots of badly fit trim pieces, mis-matched gaps, and so on. Also, it's almost 3500 lbs and has the same HP as a 1990s Buick.

To get that 250HP turbo, though, you've got to pay almost exactly 30K.

By the time you add a few options to bring it closer to what the base Verano offers (e.g. basics like USB port, Bluetooth, and heated front seats), plus destination, you're nearly at $36,000.Or a G25 pretty much fully loaded. Except the G25 is no longer offered in the USA. The least expensive G sedan now is the G37 Journey, $38,000 with no options.You can get a TSX for around $30k... although it gives up 49 horses to the Verano. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Odd, I went to Truecar and they have the G25 listed. Yes, it's a left-over 2012. The Audi is a decent car, nonethless. Then there's the Volvo C30. And the list goes on and on.The sheer number of cars in the 27-33K range is amazing as of late. And GM simply doesn't compare. The car is at least 5K overpriced for what it is. A more normal car to compare to it would be something like an Accord V6 EX. Slightly less money, way more space, a little better handling, better mpg, and so on.

I've found over the years that ""sedan"" basically means ""a normal car that's not a minivan or SUV"" in these forums. Things like whether it has a hatchback or mini-doors or is a coupe and so on are minor concerns to most people. Most people who do need the car for four people will almost always state kids or the like in their initial post. Here's why I know it's overpriced: In Europe, the car is sold as the Opel Astra. In the U.S., it is sold as a cheaper model as the Chevy Cruze. And also as the dolled-up Verano. The price difference between the two is a bit amazing, frankly. GM is at it again with badge-engineering and asking prices that are silly. This reminds me of the idiocy that was the Cadillac Cimarron. Take a Chevy Cavalier, add some bling, and increase the price by a crazy amount.You wonder why so few are being sold? 41K for a first year launch is pretty pathetic these days. 30, 20, then almost nothing... It might not even make it to 120K total sales during its production run at this rate.Plus, it looks like a jellybean. GM's 70-80 year old board of directors fascination with French names and styling queues looks incredibly dated. France might have been cutting-edge in styling back in the 50s and 60s, but it's nowhere now. We want more edgy and modern things like the CTS. What we get is overly-analyzed and anal professor approved crap that looks like it was churned out by grad students straight out of design school. We want face-punching, take no prisoners attitude and we get a polite old office worker who is still wearing the same 20 year old suit.They have a name for this in Japan. Meat-eater and Grass-eater.

Quite often most people don't care about a coupe vs a sedan enough to change their mind about a car they happen to like after they drive it. The same is true if there is a convertible option for the same car. Yes, 41K is low, but remember, that's a first year figure. The G25 was dropped after selling low numbers. I suspect the C30 is soon to die off as well. Now, the TSX is merely Honda being anal, IMO - it should be dropped as well. But it is a great car, unlike the Verano. I guess we'll look at the Verano in a year and know the real story. But GM is not known for sales increases on their models over time. And GM needs to hit home runs now as it's the 8th inning and they are running out of time and money. Not hit a bunt and hope they can get a base out of it.And, yes, the G sedan IS a fugly thing. But it handles and drives so well that it can be forgiven. Kind of Porsche and the Panamera.

It does take some getting used to, as my kid has a Versa SL hatch with it and it drives a bit differently than a regular auto tranny...not bad...just different. But once you get used to it, it's a breeze actually. I wouldn't be concerned one bit with the Honda version as they wouldn't put it out there if they had any reservations about it since it's their best selling model.The Sandman  :sick: :shades:  ","Posts: 6,101",Member

yatitle: Honda's new CVT for the 2013 Accord is getting very positive reviews from everyone. Here's just one example from Car and Driver:http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-honda-accord-sedan-first-drive-review""But it&#146;s the CVT&#146;s tuning that makes the Accord feel fleet. The typical rubber-band delay has been minimized, and the throttle responds curtly when you ask for acceleration (although sometimes with some audible transmission whine at high revs). In mountain snakers as well as on city streets, the CVT works so efficiently that it all but disappears, and you never notice the lack of a manual control....""The acceleration of the the 4 cylinder with the CVT is quick&#151;less than 8 seconds 0-60.You'll get better mpg with the 4, obviously, and so if you don't need sports car-like power that's probably the model you should go for. Let us know how it goes at the test drive!Best wishes.... ","Posts: 5,952",Member

So I've test driven a ton of cars, most of which 5 minutes or so which truly doesn't give enough time for a fair analysis of each. The Mazdaspeed3- the most boy-racer, worst gas mileage, least supportive seats, roughest riding, but by far the best performing. The Jetta GLI- love turbo power and 2.0T, easy to tune (APR/Revo/GIAC), great handler and ride, least visually appealing, spotty VW reliability, first 3 services free. Both of these require premium fuel. Lastly, the Honda Accord Sport sedan 6 speed- great handling/ride combination, super solid feeling, lots of standard features, gem of an engine, only color for me is gray, most grandpa-ish, slowest (0-60 6.7 1/4 15.3@93mph- which aren't bad), best mpgs, most proven reliability, regular unleaded, not much available to boost performance. Payments on all three would be $375-385 on 66 mos buying at invoice (less 1500 on the MS3) no money down. If I could find a low mileage 06-09 Jetta GLI 6 speed, I would have bought it already. I love that car. It's a 3rd car, daily driver for me, take my wife and boys places on occasion. We already have a 2012 Ford Fusion appearance pack car we love and a 2003 Suburban Z71.

The GLI base car is what I'm looking for. The WRX is out of my budget range and I thought the Focus ST was way to hyperactive. It was all over the place on acceleration (not spinning), the turbo didn't even really kick in until 3500-4000 rpms, and they're all loaded up with options. I hate the Civic Si's dash and the throttle overrun is terrible. If it weren't for those two things, I'd probably go with a Si, that and I don't like the newest styling. The used car I'd buy today if I could find one, is a low mileage 06-09 Jetta GLI 6 speed. The wife hates GTI's, so can't go there again. ",Posts: 12,Member

Just drove all three today. The Accord sport is out because it's just a great driving large car, we already have a 12 Fusion we love. I really love the Speed3's power and just how raw the driving experience is. Great brakes and steering. But the interior feels cheaper than the Vdub and after visiting the really annoying Mazdaspeedforum, it's plagued with interior rattles and noises. Haven't read that about the MKVI Jetta GLI. I drove the GLI I would buy today, the base car on 17"" wheels. It just really lacks the low end torque the MKV had. Very clean interior design, feels way more upscale than the Mazda. Obviously two very different cars. I can get the 13 Speed3 for $1200 less than the GLI, but VW offers .9% for 66 mos, so the payment is only $10 more for the GLI. Really tough decision here...... The Cruze is a nice looking car, rented one once with the turbo automatic. Just not in the same league powerwise and I think they're over-priced just as the Sonic. ",Posts: 12,Member

My brother in law has a 2012 Civic Si. This generation has much more low end torque, because they put in a 2.4 engine. The dash is weird, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. I think it's a lot of fun to drive and shift. Honda's manuals are about the best in the biz. Imho you should test drive it yourself before you write it offBut I've always loved VW GTIs.

No one has a Civic Si around here. After reading more on VWVortex, looks like the new Jettas are rattle traps just like my MKV GTI was. So both the Speed3 and the GLI are prone to it. Wow, it's kind of amazing the money and technology supposedly in these cars that they can't build them better. People talk trash about US made cars, but I hardly ever had Chrysler/Jeep customers complaining about noises. Our 12 Ford Fusion SE on 18"" wheels has never made any noises in 24k miles.

I thought buying a new car would be easy. Do a little homework, take a few test drives, decide, write a check for the deposit and go. Ha! I sure need some help. Here's my list: 4 doors; a trunk big enough to carry real estate signs (think full size trunk - 2 signs or 6 bags of horse feed or the bodies of 2 people who have made me unhappy enough to stash 'em in my trunk); a backup camera; sporty and luxurious all at the same time. Oh - and great fuel economy. So I ordered the 2013 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid. It hit every button on my wish list. But they don't seem to be able to deliver it. So help me - I need an alternative.

I can't see an A4 having enough trunk space. They're pretty small cars. The Q5 is a hatch and has a hybrid option. Decent sized car with excellent fuel economy...I guess ""excellent"" needs to be qualified. Sticking to hybrids...what about the Infiniti M? Bumps your price cap a bit but I personally find them to be very attractive and according to reviews drive very well. I don't have seat time in the hybrid version but have some with an M37 and was very pleased.Also to throw out a weirdo option...Chevy Volt. Eye catcher, looks are subjective as always, good mpg, gives off the green vibe that might benefit you and with the hatch should take care of signage issues. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I'd personally recommend looking at used cars a level up. For instance, the Accord in the U.S. is actually a model in-between the Civic and the Accord in Japan. What the rest of the world gets as the ""Accord"" is actually sold as the Acura TSX in the U.S.The solution then, would be to consider the real Accord, or a 2-3 year old TSX for the price of a new Civic. Better features, a bit more bling/status (never hurts), and a ton less depreciation and initial registration and taxes. These cars also are generally built better and have more safety features as well. Lastly, let some other fool eat the initial depreciation.Other cars to consider would be a similar used G37, a used Lexus IS, a used Volvo S60, or a used Cadillac CTS. All of these give you close to a proper sports-luxury feel and meet all of your criteria and then some. As for my favorite pick, it would be the CTS. GM's European division basically stole a bunch of BMW and Mercedes engineers years ago and designed the car to be a BMW 5 Series clone. Which it does very very well. The engine and car design is in Germany and the assembly and electricals (the weak part on German cars) is done in North America. (Canada, IIRC?) It also depreciates the fastest, which means used models are all over the place for $20K. www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?endYear=2013&listingId=335- 730846What's to note is that this is the direct injection model with the bigger engine. In 4 years, the price has dropped by almost 40%. It still drives like a $40K car, though. This is for CPO. If you want used, $18-20K is a more realistic number. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

My mother is in the same boat as you are. She wants a nice car that does al of that and has a bit of bling as well.There are four ways to obtain status with a car.1 - Spend a ton of money of something that gives you status and beauty.2 - Buy something that is bleeding-edge technology (hybrid/etc)3 - Have it do something that other normal cars can't. 4WD, convertible, or similar.4 - The car does an end-run around normal cars/is alternative fuel. The first is obvious but painful on the pocketbook. A hybrid is actually not good for the environment (toxic batteries) and has less and less status gain, and most convertibles are sold at an outrageous premium. The frugal way to get status/bling currently is a Diesel fuel vehicle. A car with a CDI/TDI engine. Same MPG as a hybrid but no batteries.In my mother's case, she liked the A3 TDI a lot. Much, much more than the 300H. Also, the 2012 Audi A4 wagon (CPO of course) is on the short list to buy. They aren't offering it as a 2013 model (it will return in 2014 though, refreshed and updated), unfortunately, but it's an even better choice. She liked the VW Passat TDI as well.

I have this going one another forum and thought I would bring this to a more universal sight too. I will be purchasing a car in the near future and I am going for CPO. I really want an AWD, so the S4 is my first choice. I heard the Quattro is sick. The car will mostly be used for Road trips and Weekend driving. I have a older Nissan Maxima that is my daily driver. My main issue with the Audi is that most people state that it will be costly and frequent, in the future, and I plan on keeping the car for a long time. My 96 Maxima currently has 171k on it. I live in San Antonio Tx and it can get pretty hot. Are there any reasons I should avoid the Audi besides costly repairs??? I am not a wrencher, but I am not afraid to dig in. I am open to other cars too Please give me suggestions!!! So far the cars that caught my eyes are: Infiniti G37x (looks cheap in most areas, but still a great ride) Lexus GS350 (Never owned a Toyota and this one seems pretty nice) Audi B8 S4 (so far has all the specs I want and I like to have cars I don't see on the road all the time) ***BMW 335xi is not on my radar because I see way too many BMW's out here.

The Lexus will be the cheapest to maintain but also the blandest, but it will be well appointed and luxurious. I also think it might hold up in value the best over time.The Audi will be fun to the drive, especially an S4 but yes, maintenance might be steep unless you have a decent mechanic that knows what they're doing once warranty runs out and you do not neglect it.I personally am not a fan of The G37 sedans as I think they're a tad outdated and don't feel as good as German sports sedans (I've been in the car business almost a decade and drove almost everything).I have a 3 series BMW (07 328i) and love it because handling wise it's very hard to beat.

February 2013 ",boomchek,"
First let's address your last concern: I have considered craig's list but am very skeptical due to friends/family buying vehicles with an extensive amount of repair required. Whether you buy a used car from Craigslist, Auto Trader, or even a used car dealer, you're shopping for older cars. Even when meticulously maintained, older cars will require more maintenance than new cars.A good way to know what you're getting yourself into is to have a pre purchase inspection once you look at the car and if it's in your price range. You can take it to a local mechanic you can trust or a dealership, pay for the inspection just to see if the car is somewhat mechanically sound. If it is then go for it. Keep in mind that at your price range no car will be perfect, especially an older luxury car. You should expect some imperfections or future work needing to be done. I can attest to this when I was selling my 10 year old BMW wagon and everybody expected a perfect BMW for under $6k.Look for vehicles with maintenance records as that helps you see if they were at least well taken care of.Now for your choices, from my experience all of these cars will be trouble and you should stay away from them. Any Jag repairs will be costly. The Lincoln LS I'd personally stay away from as all of the used ones I've seen (I worked in the car business for almost 10 years) had some sort of electrical issues. The Cadillac Deville, although a super nice and comfy car that I personally enjoyed can also have head gasket issues, tranny issues, and electrical issues. I've talked to a few people who knew friends who had them, plus my buddy who was a service manager at a GM dealership and he said just to stay away from them. If they develop an major engine issue, you'll easily pay in repairs what you paid for the car, or more.If looking at older luxury cars I would only recommend looking at used Lexuses like the ES300, GS models, or even older LS400 models as they tend to have Toyota reliability and be comfortable luxury cruisers especially for longer drives. They use many Toyota components so parts might be easy to find. Plus when it's time to sell them it might be easier than getting rid of a Jag, Caddy, or a Lincoln.Good luck! ","Posts: 5,528",Member

I wouldn't touch any of those cars you've listed...they're not reliable or durable....fashionable is subjective! I'm not sure what your goal is here....if you're trying to impress someone...a 12 year old luxury vehicle is not going to do it. If you just want something that has a lot of features and drives very good...along with your ""reliable, durable, and fashionable"" requirement there are a few others I would consider. 2002 Acura RL 2002 Toyota AvalonLexus GS300 (might have to go older than 2001 to make your budget)2004 Nissan Maxima2005 Buick LaCrosse (honestly don't know much about them but worth a look)Is a Lincoln Towncar on the possible list? I ask because it doesn't seem less-fashionable than a Deville....and is far more reliable particularly if you find a basic model with less electronic gizmos. Ok now...if none of that interests you here's a wild-card: 2003 Oldsmobile Aurora. Certainly different and seems no less fashionable than your previous selections. From what I can see they generally have good reliability reports and were considered one of the best sedans on the road (at the time). If nothing else even if the reliability was as bad as the three you originally listed....the cost to repair won't be as high. Good luck! ","Posts: 3,241",Member

boomcheck and others are right about the poor reliability of the cars you mention.You may not like my 2 cents, but....30 years ago I was a college student, and for many years I went through one old unreliable car after another as I went through college, grad school, and then got my first job.In retrospect I would have saved a lot of time, headaches, and frustration, and quite a bit of money too, if I'd just gotten a good new car to start with and stuck with it.I'm a Honda man myself, and so I personally would see if you could get into a new Civic or Fit.But what about this&#151;VW is offering 0% financing with no money down for 66 months on most of its models. The question is would your credit rating qualify. Possibly not. But VWs also give you free maintenance for 3 years. If you buy a ten year old car, imho, in a few years you are going to be crying uncle because of the huge repair bills, and then you'll probably have to start all over again looking for another car.If you can somehow swing new you might be happier in the long run. Cars today are significantly safer, have better performance and mpg, and are generally more reliable than cars from 10 years ago even when those 10 year old cars were new. And now that they've had who knows what abuse for that time..... ","Posts: 5,952",Member

For someone trying to save some money, I think a better idea would be a gently USED Civic or Fit... especially since the Fit hasn't changed in several years and the previous-generation Civic is in many ways better than the current car.But they are hardly luxury cars. But here's another idea... for not much more than the OP can pay up front, one could get a 3-year lease on a pretty nice car... maybe not ""luxury"", but very close to it. Some ideas there are the Passat, Sonata, Optima, and maybe others depending on lease rates. And ""auto show"" time (now) is a good time to lease or buy a new car, usually lowest prices of the year except maybe November. Very little money up front, and almost no costs during the 3 years except monthly payment, gas, insurance, and basic maintenance. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

backy has good advice. The only thing against getting a recent Civic or Fit is that they hold their value so well in the first few years that you almost might as well get a new one.Leasing might be a good idea, particularly if you don't want to get stuck with a car for a long time. 3 year lease on a 2013 Accord is available for $239/mo with 2300 down, or $300 a month with 0 down. It's not like you save by putting money down (they are both almost exactly the same $ in the end), and so it seems to me the $300 might be better.You say you wanted a luxury car? Well, I bet a 2013 Honda Accord actually offers as much or even more than most luxury cars from 10 years ago. For instance, you get integrated bluetooth, text msg display and reading, backup camera, alloy wheels, 0-60 in 7.7 seconds, which is as fast as a 6 cylinder from 10 years ago, dual climate control, etc.&#151;all standard. And an Accord will save you at least $500 a year in gas compared to a lux car from 10 years ago. Again, there's a question about if you would qualify. Don't know about that.http://automobiles.honda.com/accord-sedan/If, in a few years, after you've graduated and are making a good income and want a true luxe car, just turn it in and buy a BMW or Lincoln whatever.....Similar lease deals, or even cheaper, can be had on Optima, Sonata, Passat, etc. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

1 - avoid anything European unless you are willing to go much older and more ""classic"" like a 318Ti or similar E36 series BMW, possibly. Or a late 90s Volvo 850 or a Mercedes C class of the same vintage. (before they got all round and plastic). The main reason is because spare parts and aftermarket clubs and support are easy to find, and they aren't complicated to the point where you can't fix them yourself.2 - Lincoln/Ford makes exactly one car that would fit your criteria, the Grand Marquis. Make sure that it's in dark blue or dark red if possible and has the luxury trim package so that it doesn't look like a cop car. (white, black, and tan are NG). They are inexpensive and actually are quite reliable. Parts are cheap as well. Huge trunk as well.3 - GM makes a good car for you. It's NOT the Cadillac. It's the same thing with a Buick badge on it for thousands less. Ie - a Buick Lucerne. These can be had for around your price range with the V6 engine. It's basically a Toyota Avalon clone, though, so it's not really ""luxury"". And while it's as reliable as a tank, it unfortunately handles and accelerates like one. Comfy but sedate would be the way I would describe it.My top pick, though, is actually something completely different. I'd give serious consideration to a vehicle with sporty and luxury feel and driving while not being a massive boat that gets 18mpg. This leaves, as I mentioned, an older BMW, Volvo, or Mercedes, or something good from Japan. Which there are tons of cars like this for sale. For instance, a used Lexus IS300 is an excellent choice. A bit of luxury and a bit of sporty at the same time. Reliability is decent and it is quite fun to drive. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Would a sporty 4 door work as well? I'm not talking GM crap, but more Euro sedans like a BMW or Mercedes. IME, it pays to just go to these sorts of cars if you are buying used, and just do it right. Everything else will simply be a sporty looking exterior with a rental car soul.My top pick would be a late (1998 or so) BMW E36. Chose your body style, they're all the same fantastic car underneath. Also, Mercedes made the C230K (sedan and coupe) that got 30mpg and could be had with a manual (thereby avoiding the one major problem area, the automatic transmission). Volvo makes real sleepers sometimes. The 60 series cars were/are excellent and on nobody's radar. But put a manual in it, and it's old-school European fun all over again. VW made the (new)Jetta around that time as well, that could be had with a V6 (VR6) engine. Very nice and very quick. Avoid the 4 and turbo models of that era, though. Repairs aren't that cheap, but you do get a fantastic driving experience. (actually the last time I got a part from Toyota for my 4Runner, it was more than I'd paid two years earlier for a similar part for my Mercedes)For Japan, really only one vehicle shines as a European clone/competitor in that price range. That is the Lexus IS300 Sport. To me, it had that magic weight distribution and performance that just made it a joy to drive. The IS350 lost that and became more like everyone else's muscle car, and the IS250 was... too slow and heavy. If you've ever driven an old BMW or Volvo (240 turbo or similar), you'll feel like it's a modern version of the same idea. Light, agile, and very well composed. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

An alternative to an Accord coupe is the Camry Solara. Kinda rare in this price range, but would be reliable and would have a decent trunk. Looks pretty sporty even if it doesn't DRIVE sporty.The Celica would be a good choice also, esp. in hatchback form... no, not a true coupe then, but two doors and the hatch would be more versatile than a coupe.

So over the past few months I've researched and test driven a few cars and I'm still at a standstill in the conclusion. My top choices are as follows: 2009-2012 BMW 3 series (328i,330i,335i), Dodge Dart limited, or 2009-2012 Audi A4. I don't know all the differences with the BMW series but I love the sleek fine design they have and the prestige reputation of comfort and reliability. Any owner reviews or suggestions would be appreciated. I'd be looking into purchasing a used model, what's the best year 2009-2012?Audi A4 is along the lines of the BMW series but I don't see what makes them different than BMW besides slight price range. Better than BMW?The Dodge Dart Limited, I know, seems crazy to be compared to the other giants, however after test driving a few darts I was surprised how much they bring to the table when fully loaded (costs approx. 27,000 loaded)What I'm looking for in a vehicle:1. $30,000 price range, new or used 2. Coupe or Sedan with comfortable front seats, back seats do not matter no comfort. (I am 6 foot tall)3. Comfort, for long and short rides4. Fuel efficiency 26+ MPG combined5. Premium audio system6. Reliability for 5+ years7. Insurance costs: anything not labeled a ""sports car"" ",Posts: 3,Member

I've seen some Dart's on the road and the look decent. Kind of reminds me of 1994 when the go-cart-ish Dodge Neon hit the streets....and was quite the hit for awhile. Dodge has a history of some very trendy cool cars....for a few years then they age quickly and fade. I'd hate to drop $27k on one though regardless....I think it will be worth next to nothing in five years. I think either the 3-series or A4 would be a decent vehicle. Should be relatively reliable but you will spend a lot on maintenance and even minor repairs. If you really like the cars though...it can be worth it. I would much rather buy a used 3 than a new Dart for the same money. If we're talking $20k then perhaps it's a different story. MPG on the germans likely isn't going to hit your target even if the EPA says so. The Audi turbo doesn't do as well as the EPA sticker says. One other neg to the germans is that insurance will likely be pricey if you're younger (as it sounds).Just to throw out another worth checking out....Altima V6. Should be right in that price range loaded out, good performance (not Euro-worthy but not bad), decent features, cheaper insurance, mpg should be close, and should be a smooth five years in the maintenance/reliability category.

Dart? First model year? And $27k? I'd rather have someone else take that plunge. If I'm really serious about reliability over a 5 year period, I'd be leery of any used Audi too. A CPO 3 series would be a better bet; I had a solid BMW experience but the maintenance is higher. I like sebring's Altima suggestion and I'd throw out the new Accord as well; you can get a Sport model (even with a 6sp MT!) that has received great reviews, looks good and it seems like a stupid good value for the money. You can get a V6 like the Nissan, too. ","Posts: 3,007",Member

I'd skip the Dart as well. In 5 years you'll be lucky to get $5k for it on trade. Just look at what 07 Calibers (Dodge's small car back then) are trading selling for. Actually look at what 10 year old Neons (SX 2.0) are selling for vs 13 year old BMW's. Even though you're getting an older BMW for the money it will depreciate slower than the Dart. Also expect a few hundred thousand Darts to go into rental and lease fleets for 4 years and once they come back onto the market the values will drop.I'd only get a Dart if it's on a dirt cheap short term (24-36 month) lease.Audi and BMW sounds nice but from personal opinion the 3 series will have better handling and reliability than the Audi.I have an 07 328i and absolutely love it. If you do get a 3 series I'd strongly recommend extended warranty or buying a Certified Pre Owned model with factory warranty that covers everything (bumper to bumper). It's well worth the money so much so that when mine ran out I bought another 2 years of warranty at the dealership I worked at. I've been in the car business and saw what problems can cost on these cars.With my BMW the only problem I ran into was a vavle cover and some that warped and some tensioners that needed to be replaced at around 100,000kms (60k miles) which would have cost me about $2k if it wasn't for my warranty.Otherwise the car's been great but maintenance will cost you more than a Dodge or Honda. Oil changes run about $200 here in Canada but they last about 9 months to 1 year. These cars also have runflats which are expensive to replace if bought from the dealer and there is no room in the trunk for a spare. These 3 series don't even come with a jack believe it or not.However the driving dynamics and handling are among the best of almost any car out there. If you do go for a 3 series, look for one with the Sports Package. These will have 1/2 inch lower suspension, different steering wheel, and deep bolstered seats, also among the best of any car on the market. Good luck! ","Posts: 5,528",Member

Well, actually, we just traded my sister's Caliber SXT and it wound up working out pretty well for them. Bought it when they first came out for $16k, had it for near 6 years, didn't take good care of it, and traded it a few weeks ago for $4500. So roughly $2k/yr in depreciation. That's actually pretty damned good for buying new.Of course, it was a cheap car, which limits the downside significantly. I wouldn't suggest paying $27k for a Dart. I'm sure you are right ... that would hurt in the end. But loading up a car with options usually does. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Exactly. If you were to trade a loaded Caliber that had $5k of extra options it would probably have been worth about $5k-$5.5k. So a fully loaded domestic compact at full sticker will result in higher overall depreciation to to the higher initial cost. ","Posts: 5,528",Member

The completely free maintenance for 4 years is a really nice added value with a new BMW. From their website:Compare the true cost of other luxury vehicles to the exceptional value of a BMW.With BMW you get a well-equipped model along with our no-cost maintenance program - and with many models, our no-cost BMW Assist&#153; Safety Plan - for the first four years or 50,000 miles. Not to mention a selection of vehicles that consistently receive top honors from the automotive press.It's a vehicle so advanced, it even comes equipped with peace-of-mind at no additional fee.

By extra options I meant base model vs a fully loaded model with $5k of extra (base Caliber SE vs loaded Caliber SXT with every option).

I need to start to research a new Sedan or SUV. Current car is having issues (transmission fluid leak) and that is strike two for it. One more strike and it's out so I'm starting to look now.Must have for the new car: quiet, smooth, powerful, stylish, tech, fits 2 kids, under 40k. BULLETPROOF.Quiet cabin: able to have a conversation at highway speeds. Isolated from road noise. I think of Mercedes Benz when I think of this.Smooth: Handles bumps in the road well, shrugs off potholes, not too firm without being 'floaty'Power: Hard to quantify, my car has ~270 hp / 270 ft/lb torque. 0-60 6.5 or so. At least close to that if not more. 300+ hp would be great but not a deal breaker.Stylish: eye of the beholder so whatever you consider a good looking car. Sporty, lux-sport, SUV, whatever.Tech: Back up camera, bluetooth, ipod connection, controls on dash, push start, auto lights, decent stereo. Would love a voice control system like Ford SYNC or similar.Under 40k. Ideally under 35k, or as little as I'd have to spend to get these features. Would consider pre-owned.Fit's 2 kids. 1 car seat and 1 booster seat.Oh I forgot one of the most important things: Bulletproof. Reliable, low maintenance.

I think it would help a lot if you could narrow it down to an SUV or a Sedan first...there's a pretty big gap between some of your wants...for example 270-300hp in an SUV doesn't typically get you 0-60 times in the 6.5 range. In fact, SUV choices with that type of acceleration performance isn't common at all. The cash also doesn't go nearly as far on an SUV....$35-$40k is very low-end of the luxury scale. You'll even find some non-luxury brands pricing well beyond that. In the car world...I would look at the Acura TL with Tech pkg. I think it hits all your buttons and should ring up around $38k for new. All-wheel-drive is also available if that's something you found desirable about the SUV. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Thanks Sebring,I would prefer a sedan but I just didn't want to eliminate an SUV. If the consensus is I'd need to spend over 40k to get those needs I'll have to consider it, or lease. I do live in the NE so I've been thinking AWD or FWD. The 2004 Infiniti G35 I had was horrible in the snow, that's my only experience with RWD. This would pair with my wifes Honda CRV so we already have a family hauler, but mine needs to fit 2 kids occasionally.A last note would be I dont put many miles on my cars.

My parents were wanting a new car and the final three were the C class, the CTS, and the G37 in that order. But they got the CTS due to my dad's getting a better rebate and cashing in his credit card points.The C class is perhaps the best car in this segment if you want a perfect little luxury car. You want the C300 with only the panoramic sunroof and the spoiler. Sand Beige Metallic is the best combo with the black of the sunroof. White is a close second. No other options. This keeps the cost down.http://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?endYear=2013&listin- - - - - gId=335126964Here is a typical CPO example. Note how the entire top is dark glass, essentially. Why pay $40K? Note - the E is basically a stretched C class and offers no real improvements over the C class/it's not really a step up. The C class is quite agile and you really don't need the sport package on it unless you like mountain roads and a non-luxury ride (the tires are just too stiff, IMO)The CTS was a close second, almost too close to pick between the two. Different looks, but much of the same feel. GM essentially stole away engineers from BMW and Mercedes over a decade or so to work on its new line which turned into the CTS. German built engine, tested at the Nurburgring, and assembled in North America.(so electronics and interior bits are reliable). Honestly it drives almost exactly like a BMW 5 series, but the CPO models are outrageously low priced. Get the luxury model as the sport is far to harsh of a ride. (yes, there's unfortunately a pattern here as of late)The G37 is basically a Japanese 5 series, IMO. It's put together perfectly, IMO. It feels great, drives great, and looks great. But while it is a great car, it doesn't have the bling factor or *quite* the refinement of the Cadillac or Mercedes. That's usually a major factor with the wife, IMO. :PNote - IMO, if you want a bit of status as well as luxury, while there are a lot of people leasing BMWs and other makes, almost nobody leases a Cadillac. Poor people don't drive them as a rule. The same image applies to Mercedes as well. Even when I was driving around in my 1967 230S years ago, I got looks from people as it still commanded respect and a bit of jealously as it wasn't anything like a typical sedan. :shades: Of course, you could get this and be done with it/not need a car for another decade or two:http://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?zip=91106listingId=- 3359552A little bit over budget, but... yeah, it's the real deal. If you're even remotely looking at the E, just get a CPO S. Nobody that I know of has ever regretted buying a S class. Well, I suppose there are some, but... very few. Black, white, and green are the only colors. It's like a Ferrari. Red or black. Anything else is just wrong. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

1. I would have to want something that's in the ""ultra-luxury pkg"" pretty seriously to pay $2k for a year older car with an extra 10k miles. So that's your call...if there's something in that pkg you want bad enough. 2. As you alluded, it's pretty tough to say how much you can bargain. It comes down to what they happen to have in the car and how good you are at bargaining. Telling them you're desperate to buy a car ASAP is not going to help...I would start with ""what's your best price if we close this deal today"". Honestly neither seem like a bad price as-is.

For starters, lets discuss colorsThe 2009 with less features is Gray with Black interior.The 2008 Ultra Luxury Pkg is Sapphire Black Pearl with Cashmere interior (very light).Would you be happy with either of those two color combos? The good news about the Lexus CPO warranty is that covers the vehicle for 3-years from the time you purchase the car OR until the car has 100k total vehicle miles. The 2009 has 45k miles and the 2008 has 52k miles, a difference of 7k miles is negligible.The Ultra-Luxury Package on the 2008 is actually rather impressive. It was a $5280 option when the car was new and it adds all of the following features-Power Glass MoonroofPerforated Leather Seats, Heated and Ventilated in frontRear seat electric blindSlightly lower profile tires for cleaner, upscale lookRain-sensing automatic wipersMemory settings for Side Mirrors, Steering Column adjustments and Driver&#146;s SeatBluetooth Audio Lexus Premium Audio System and Navigation SystemVoice activation functionality for NAV and Bluetooth devicesWood & Genuine Leather Steering Wheel and Gear Shift KnobRear Seat Side AirbagsHID (high intensity discharge) headlightsAdaptive Front Lighting System (AFS) beams turn at same angle as front wheels, literally lighting around curves or cornersOut of these extra features, the ones that appeal to me the most are-Perforated, Top-Quality Leather Seats with Heated and Ventilated (cooled) Front SeatsUpgraded Lexus Premium Audio SystemHID headlamps with AFS Real wood and genuine leather steering wheel and wood shifter knobThose are all features that I have experiences in various Lexus models and they definitely make the interior feel much more luxurious. Unfortunately, the 2009 doesn&#146;t have a lot of detailed info listing options other than Navigation. It doesn&#146;t even have photos of the actual car, just stock Lexus photos.I checked the pricing of both cars with KBB and Edmunds and both cars are fairly priced, especially the 2008 which has a CPO Retail value of up to $26,125 according to KBB! The 2009 is worth around $22,500 unless it has more high-value options that I didn&#146;t&#146; include in the calculation.If you like the exterior and interior colors of the 2008 model, I strongly suggest going for that one! It is only $2000 more and you will probably keep this car for 5+ years! Pamper yourself and go for it! It&#146;s a wise investment also because the Ultra Luxury Package will increase the value and make it much more desirable when the time comes that you do sell it or trade it in on a new one! =) ",Posts: 801,Member

I'd go with the newer lower priced, lower mileage model unless, like others said, you love some or most of the features of the ultra luxury package.Also if I read correctly the newer one has a dark interior vs the older one has a light interior. Depending on the region you live in, light interiors can get dirty quite fast if you live in a region with lots of rain, slush, mud, and will age your vehicle quite fast. ","Posts: 5,528",Member

Plekto - thanks for your detailed message. Helpful dialogue going w/Dash 5's""problem"" - especially since I have some of the same issues as his & your parents(of which, at 70, I'm either same generation or older).  I'd really like a wagon - as a widow I need some hauling capability, but few out there. Want lux & ""badge"" on inside more than outside. Looked at CTS wagon - but the lux, gets expensive very fast (as a 70 year-old, still too much image of ""senior"" wealthy man.) My car history: VW bug, Karman Ghia, '70's Audi Fox, 76 BMW 530i, '88 Acura Legend, '97 Infiniti I30 t (only car didn't like - felt too much like going to weekly ladies' club meetings) , 2003 Murano SE.

Funny that you should mention that. My mom is looking for a new car as well. It turns out while she likes the CTS, she also wants a smaller wagon or SUV for hauling stuff. My dad I think has also been secretly coveting the CTS as his LeSabre is approaching 15 years old now. (grin)It is unfortunate that the best larger wagon out there is the CTS. Which GM has decided to do the typical markup on that you'd typically see with a convertible. That is, just because they can and not because the car is really any different other than one part of the car being different/changed. Cadillacs drop value like a stone, though, so a CPO wagon can be had a couple of years old for $30K or less. But that's true for most luxury cars. You are best to buy them CPO and keep them until the wheels start to rust off. That said, the CTS wagon does drive well and not like a SUV.Yes, the Inifniti simply looks like a boot on wheels. It's oddly squashed and curved and looks just a bit off to my eyes as well. Nice car inside, though. Drives great. Just that Japanese styling as of late is looking more and more like a cartoon. They even try to make the cars have ""faces"" on them. :P The only other luxury wagons out there that are any good, are the Audi A3 and A4 allroad since 2012, the Volvo C30, and the E class wagon (pricey).My vote based upon your previous cars is the A3 since it's like a luxury version of a Fit or Mini but it actually is a proper car instead of a fashion statement for young people. It can also be had with a TDI engine which gets it hybrid mpg and a bit of bling not because of the price but because it does something other cars don't. The price, new, is also quite reasonable. The A4/Allroad is the same thing but bigger. It also has the excellent (real) AWD system as well.The only down-side is that Audi is stopping importing all wagons for next year according to my local dealer. So supplies are getting tight unless you want to pay to have one made and wait 2 months. As for SUVs and Crossovers, the best is still the original, the Lexus RH. The Cadillac SRX is basically a CTS on steriods. Id's rate this as 2nd choice if it weren't the fact that the CTS wagon is a better vehicle in almost every way, especially gas mileage and handling. A CPO RH is about the only crossover that I'd recommend. Not because it is better than the others so much as it doesn't fail in critical areas or drive like a truck like most of the others.

Thanks very much for this plekto. That white C brought back the memories of my parents old Benz in a much sleeker and more modern package. That car is beautiful in white. I have a guy who knows a guy... kinda thing with a Mercedes dealership. Supposedly he always buys his cars there, nice guy etc. Will have to check that out.That said, I got my car back from the shop yesterday and I did miss it. It's got two strikes, next problem I'm getting rid of it and look at the C300 and CTS.That Honda V6 others mentioned is great on paper, and I dont care too much about badge (again I'm driving a Kia Optima SX atm) but it just looks like a boring car.

Plekto & Dash5 - With your MB memories it brings to mind my father's 1954 (last year made?) I think 220 convertible (not gull wing but handles at other end of doorto open into space rather than door panel); very small back seat & trunk but hasluggage fit to it. I & brothers still have, paying thru nose for repair to sell! WouldLOVE to buy brothers out but can't afford!! (And, of course has NO hauling!!)Pletko - do you have my number!! 'Tho I haven't ridden in/driven it, I think (except for $) my ideal car would be an Audi Avant 6 (no longer sold here). Daughter thinks an A4 would be great for me, I think it's too small - plus not sure I'm up for repair costs. Car & Driver are Audi maniacs;however, the Allroad hasn't received their supreme approval. Lexus has always been ""squishy"" driving to me-comfort over tight suspension. Car I almost bought ('cause of no real wagon alternative) 'till I discovered last year was it's last was the Mazda CX-7because of it's more ""sporty"" handling. Soooo many thanks for your help - both of my daughters are ready to disown me due to my lack of decision-making on this problem!! ",Posts: 16,Member

The A6 Avant was replaced essentially by the Allroad. It;s kind of in-between the A4 and A6, and is lifted an inch or so due to the Quattro system.It's a great car. And a shame that it looks like 2013 is the last year it will be imported. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hello Motor Enthusiasts! I have a dilemma and I need your help!So I'm selling my 2003 Toyota MR2 Spyder because I've come to realize it is not a very practical car for a 21 yr old Law Student. I need help deciding what kind of car to get. I've been researching and researching (more than I have been for school) but I cant seem to narrow down my choice, so I must turn to your wise hands for help! What I'm Looking For:-Reliability-Speed- Uniqueness- Gas Efficiency- A Sedan- Below 90k miles - 03 at the oldestI know realistically that all of these qualities can't be found in a single car, but I want the most that I can, with Reliability being the most important!What I've looked at:-Audi A4- VW GLI- Acura TL- Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V- Saab 9-3Any information on what is better (or even a new car I haven't mentioned) would be incredibly helpful. I'm going insane trying to pick the right car!I should also mention that my price limit is 10k, but below that is fine too!Also I live in Chicago, so snow is a factor.Nick ",Posts: 4,Member

Hi Nicolai,If reliability is your number one priority, then you might as well remove the Audi A4, the VW, and the Saab 9-3 off your list.The Audi and VW will have frequent issues and cost more than average to repair and the Saab 9-3 will be expensive, as Saab has been discontinued, parts are scarce and expensive, and it might be harder selling it later on.Teh Acura TL is a very good choice and the Nissan Snetra SER too. Personally I'd go for an Acura TL and would also suggest a Subaru Legacy sedan GT. They redesigned them in 2004 so 2004 and up you can find for under $10k.In my opinion they are nice cars, reliable, somewhat sporty, look good, and have AWD, and are within your price range.

My mom had a Saab 9-3, I think it was an 04 model. When Saab shut its doors, only one place remained in our city to get anything fixed and to get any parts. Parts took a while to arrive because they wouldn't order one part, but rather in bulk, after they had enough orders for a specific part, so it took months for parts to arrive.Then when it was time to sell it, everyone was scared to buy it because of parts availability and small network of repair shops to fix the cars.Volvos are decent but I do't trust them personally. Every Volvo I ever came across in my 10 years of auto sales, whether it was a 10 year old Volvo, or a 3 year old Volvo, had some sort of an electronic issue.Looks if you want reliability and luxury, then go for a Lexus, but otherwise if you choose anything European, prepare to spend a good coin on upkeep and maintenance.

Well, let's see... I think one of the toughest of your requirements is uniqueness. You certainly aren't unique in a TL. I would suggest a 3-series, but, again, not unique by any means.In any case, for your price cap, you'd have to go to a pre-'04 TL, which I believe only came with an auto trans that has reliability issues.I'd also suggest avoiding the spec V. It has a fatal flaw where the precat can spit debris back into the engine and destroy it. And, as previously pointed out, you can write off Audi and Saab if you want trouble-free motoring.So we have the aforementioned 3-series if you can overlook the commonality of it. An '04 325i is actually cheaper than a TL. A base model with under 90k could be had for about $7k retail, while a more loaded model would push $9-10k. Snow isn't an issue with snow tires.NOW, a VW... you could feasibly get an '07 GLI very close to your cap. That would be the far more reliable 2.0T. There are a couple of issues to be on the lookout for, so you'll want to get it checked out. The biggest being the fuel pump cam follower. If it was ever let to wear through, it can score the cam. It can easily be inspected prior to purchase and then its just a matter of checking it periodically and changing it once in a blue moon. Another suggestion? WRX. Or even a Legacy 2.5GT, although neither of those will return very good gas mileage. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Oh, thought of a few more.A G35 or a 3.5 Altima. Only the manual trans because, while gas mileage still won't be great, it is far better than the automatic in the real world. Will be tough to find, though.I'd also suggest trying out a 2.3 mazda3 5-spd. While not exactly speedy, it is a very fun car. Or, if you can manage to find one, a low-mileage mazdaspeed protege. That will be a bit older, of course. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I agree with where gbrozen is going with this...the TL and Sentra from that gen is not the most reliable....nor are any of the others on the list. The 3 can have issues...but a good indi mechanic should drain the account too much...but I would still recommend something a little more main stream. The altima is a good choice but you might also look at the Acura TSX. Fairly fun to drive too. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

RWD is not an issue with snow tires, like I said.

The only issue I had was squeezing past all the other cars that were stuck on on and off ramps on the highway. My FWD volvo with snow tires doesn't even do as well since the front tires have to do the steering and acceleration. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I'd stay away from any of the GM options...S-10 or Colorado/Canyon. You're looking at a very old vehicle with the S-10 and the Canyon/Colorado is garbage from all my experience. So there's not much to pick from once you eliminate the Toyota...and there's usually a reason they command the money. So I guess Ford Ranger is about it.

Stick with front wheel drive. Make life easier on yourself. Snow tires are another expense you don't need if you get Front wheel drive This is simply not true. While you can muddle along at slower speeds without snow tires or chains with a front wheel drive car, you will in no way come close to the performance that you'll get with any car with snow tires. It's exactly like wearing a pair of Converse high-tops to do hiking. Regular tires are simply the wrong tool for the job.In fact, snow tires will even beat an all wheel drive car with all-seasons on it.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4shttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGfvyPtYR0YComparisons of different tire typeshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STaximkaQxo4WD and normal tires vs RWD and snow tires. The ""trick"" that everyone in Europe uses is that they have snow tires on all of those German cars which are RWD. Only in the U.S. do we see people who simply ignore reality and figure that they can make due with normal tires wherever they go.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXupo38PewSubaru with all-season tires vs a Mini with snow tires.When they say ""prepare your car for winter"" they mean swap the tires and rims when it's going to start snowing. Most people should keep a separate set of winter tires to swap out in their garage. It's a larger initial cost, but given that the each set are only getting used for half the year, it's no more expensive in the long-run.Or, you can end up on Youtube like this.

I have lived in Ohio for 30 years and have had front wheel drive for every car but one, and my daughter made it thru 4 years in Beloit ( 1 hour from Chicago) with a Toyota Camry. We've done fine. The majority of cars in the east are front wheel drive because people like them and they get good fuel economy. That said, if the poster wants a Rwd car I would recommend what he/she wants. My impression was the leaning was towards a fwd vehicle with good mileage. Hence I am simply pointing out that that is perfectly doable on Chicago. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65UfKUS9-mQSummer tires actually turn hard at temperatures below 45F. (ouch - that's 1/3 of the year, even in California!) All-seasons are a bit better and are good down to 0C. But beyond that, they are essentially as dangerous as summer tires. It got down to 28 degrees a month ago. And I'm in Los Angeles. All-seasons sort of work in a pinch if there's no snow or if it's cold and the roads are perfectly dry (since the road friction will warm them up just enough after a few minutes), but if there's actual snow or ice, it's way too cold even for ""all-seasons"".Note - they really should be called ""three season"" tires. Winter is simply not their place.http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/safetyBelow45.dosWatch the little embedded video. It's not the snow that's the real problem so much as the winter tires stay soft enough down to about -20F. Below that, of course, you really do need chains or studded tires. Of course, the opposite is true as well. Above 45F, winter tires are basically racing tires and wear incredibly quickly. So most people use all-seasons in the spring through fall and then switch to winter tires when the first snow comes.Note - if you have a truck and are running Mud Terrains on it, they are essentially snow tires compound-wise. Which is why you typically get 30K out of a set. This is why a lot of SUVs also end up in the ditch. All-terrains are the same rubber as all-season tires. And while they will work a bit better due to bigger treads, the tread blocks also get rock-hard when it's below freezing. This is why you see all serious off-roaders just running with MTs on all year round and dealing with the need to swap their tires every other year. They aren't as good as dedicated studded snow tires (tend to pack with snow quickly), but at least won't get hard when it gets below freezing. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Yeah that's all over the place. Seat comfort is very subjective....I wouldn't take others comments too seriously. You really just need to spend some seat time and see what you think. I've found anything that's more upright like the SUV's is more comfortable and easy in/out. There RAV4 might be a decent option for you...but when you say the Altima V6 gets bad gas mileage....the RAV4 will be worse and slower to boot. You might also confirm the Altima ""requires"" premium fuel before ruling it out. I have a coworker with an '07 and absolutely loves it with over 150k miles. Very quick and comfortable. Most later Nissans (i have an '08 Pathfinder) state ""premium fuel recommended for maximum performance"". I run premium when towing...and can tell a difference under heavy load but generally I have run regular gas for 90k miles with no complaints. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

They are very popular cars. I speak as a Maxima owner myself. I'm looking at a new car and don't want premium fuel either. The new Altima seems bigger and somewhat more floaty to me than the last version. I have several friends who have the 2010 version and it is really nice. That would fit your price range too. The V6 will be quieter than the 4 cyl. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Myself and my friends have owned pretty much every truck and SUV of note that's capable of off-road use or for work (as opposed to yuppie ""soft-roaders"").The best two for work are the Chevy/GMC 1500 and the F150 (who would have guessed - heh )Other than that, though, it comes down to one choice. Get a Toyota with the 3RZ engine in it. Get it with manual. The automatic is terrible but the older Toyota manuals are bulletproof. Mine lasted 280K miles before I had to get it replaced. And not a minute of that was anyone giving it any love, either. The truck is still running around somewhere in N. Cal I think with about 350K on it (sold it at almost 325K on it two years ago).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RZ_engineNothing else works like it does in terms of low cost to maintain and the durability overall. There are several vehicles that used it, so you have a good range of years and models to look at. The newer TR and ZR 2.7L engines are also good, but they lack the tractor simplicity of the RZ.And, yes, manual with short gearing and 160HP will out-accelerate most yuppic-mobiles unless they floor it. I found it to be extremely enjoyable to drive, even in So Cal traffic as I'd just leave it in 2nd or 3rd gear and trundle along in heavy traffic. And then when I had to dodge into a gap in traffic, I was already in the right gear. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

That's a tough order. One car came to mind, though, and that was the Pontiac G8. GM did a horrible job of marketing it, but it was the best selling car in Australia at the time. Quality is/was excellent and it's a good mid-sized sedan. Of note, though, is the fact that it is rear wheel drive so it turns and parks like a whole size smaller FWD car.The problem is finding one as most people who have one simply aren't interested in selling theirs.The only real downside is the fuel economy. It gets about 25mpg highway. But other than the issue of MPG, it's probably the best solution that I can work out since you won't want a European car. It does use normal 87 octane fuel, though, so that's worth about 2mpg right there vs a higher mpg car that requires premium. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

well, he specified auto trans. So how does the Toyota stack up with that in mind? Hell, I still think the 22RE engine with manual trans was the most bulletproof setup ... but good luck finding that with low miles and no rust. EDIT: I just looked it up. Even an '02 Tacoma 2wd reg cab with 100k miles is going to be well over the OP's budget. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I, too am looking to buy something different. I do not like driving what everyone else has. I had an appointment to test drive a Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT this weekend and sell my BMW. Was very serious about it, then I talked to my insurance agent and the insurance rates on the Maserati made me cancel everything! I LOVED my Jaguar S-Type R. 'She' did save me and daughter's life, we were hit by a drunk driver at 50+mph and 'she' held tough. I do not like the XF can't get over how it looks like a Chrysler in the front and Toyota in the back. :-( Can't seem to get too excited about the F-Type coming out this fall. When I say I prefer 'foreign' I mean European. I truly have looked and looked and I can't seem to get too excited about much. I am looking for something that when I go out into my garage I have a smile on my face. I like the look of a sedan. Two or Four door does not matter. I only buy used and don't mind the year, but would prefer that it look very close to it's newer counterpart. I'm not asking for much, right?

I'm looking for a new, full-size 4-door sedan for my father. The biggest concern is that he has had both a hip and knee replacement and needs extra room for his knee. In other words, in the Toyota Camry that he currently has, his right knee always bumps into the middle console. He used to have a Chevy Tahoe and loved the leg room, but for other reasons, he needs a sedan instead of an SUV, but one that has maximum room for the right knee.$40,000 is the maximum he can spend, but he'd prefer something less expensive.Does anyone have any suggestions?

Finding something without a center console is the trick. That's getting to be almost impossible in the sedan world....the only new vehicle I can think of is the Impala. It is still available with a front bench seat on certain models....and might not be a bad option for him. They're not the greatest vehicles by a long shot...but if used as intended they can be decent. I had a rental not long ago and outside of the sloppy handling it was fairly comfortable, good power, and impressive mpg. It's not something I would pick on its own...but if I needed a comfortable sedan and had a knee issue...it might be at the top of the list. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I had a spinal fusion when I was 30 and they had to saw into my right hip to get 'bone material' for the procedure. It was either that or cadaver bone and the success rate was much lower if I used the stuff from a corpse. The surgeon told me that I would have periodic pain in my hip for the rest of my life, but I didn't give it another thought. I was far more concerned about him cutting my throat, retracting my esophagus, removing the damaged discs in my cervical spine and inserting the hip bone material and protein powder in place of the two damaged discs! The he capped it off by putting titanium plates over it all and securing them with two screws in each of the three vertebrae...fun stuff! Long story short, I'm 38 now and my right hip hurts like a SOB quite often, especially in the car! I'm 6'2"" and the center console in my Mazda3 is rather confining, especially on longer drives! So I can only imagine what it's like for your dad...The choices are very few, unfortunately.As mentioned, the 2013 Impala LS and LT are available with a 40/20/40 bench seat as an option for $195. It isn't available with the Sunroof or LT Luxury Package, so that means no Leather and no power adjustments for the driver's seat. Also, the 2014 Impala is a new design, so the 2013 will soon be gone!That is really the only sedan without a center console. I know you said an SUV no longer met his needs, but what about a minivan? The Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna both have high dash-mounted shifters that allows a break between the center console and the dash. It would allow a lot of extra right leg room! One other oddball that I'll include for the sake of being thorough is the Nissan Cube. I certainly don't like it and I doubt a former Tahoe owner would be interested, but it has a very low center console (near the floor) so it's well below the lever the front seats. I believe it originally came with a column shifter, but I could be wrong.Personally, I'd buy an Odyssey EX or EX-L...but I hope you find something that will work for him! =) ",Posts: 801,Member

The 2011 Buick Lucerne and Cadillac DTS could be had with bench seats up front. They are much, much better cars than the Impala. Since you'd be looking at CPO cars, I doubt if you'd even spend close to $30K, let alone $40K. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Obviously if you start talking used there are are a few more options with bench seats. I would not say the Lucerne is ""much, much better"" than a '12 Impala. The powertrain difference alone would keep me in the more basic Impala. The Lucerne is very similar overall but has a few extra gizmos. Pass. DTS is a nicer car if you can live with the performance to economy ratio being far less than many others. It's a shame the only options are antiques!! I would be curious why a ""sedan"" is the only option. There are a couple cross-over type vehicles that might work...as mentioned the Soul. I'm thinking the CRV also has a lot more room up front.

I'd say that the Impala is a significant step down from the Lucerne or DTS. The V8 in both is a great combination with the transmission. The seats are much better, and there are a lot of extras added if you get the better trim models.Most of all, though, is that the Lucerne CXS and DTS with the performance trim has the same electronic suspension as a Corvette, the Audi R8, and the Ferrari 599. The electromagnetic suspension on it is a drastic step up and makes it handle better than a typical GM car half it's size. It frankly drives as nicely as a S Class. The new Range Rover Evoke uses it as well. And of course, most of the Cadillac line.And that's a world better than any Impala. Shockingly so in actual driving. It's a shame that GM isn't marketing it more aggressively or including it in all of their vehicles. These cars may be ""antiques"" in your mind, but the reality is that it's the Impala that's still using 1980s technology underneath that shiny exterior.Lastly, a typical CPO DTS or Lucerne will have hardly any miles on it. It's not hard to find CPO models with 20K or less on them. That's really not even worth worrying about when there's 10K or more in savings on the table. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Last gen V8 with a 4-speed auto....ok I'll give you 90's tech. Impala has more HP from 3.6L and 6-speed auto...never mind much better fuel mileage. And the bench seat isn't available in the CXS or Platinum DTS...so you're stuck with lower end models.....a very mediocre V6/4-speed combo on the Buick or plain jane lousy handling with the Caddy. If you're stuck buying a mediocre car, you might as well buy the cheaper of them! ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I think the DTS with the performance option could be had with a bench seat. I'm not exactly sure about it, though. As for the engines, the Impala might make more hp at screaming high RPMs that would require you to literally be driving around town at 60mph in 2nd gear to achieve due to the mile-high gearing, but the V8s offer far more torque down low and as a result get in and out of traffic a lot better.I'd say the DTS has a better interior by far, though, even in the base trim. As a bonus, the DTS has a terrible depreciation. It's closer to $30K for a 2011 model and that's great news for the original poster. $50K new and close to half that in three years. Problem solved and it's actually less than a new Impala. ($30K starting price, plus options?) Add in lower initial registration and insurance as it's not ""new"", and you're looking at getting a Cadillac for Chevy prices. I'd call that an acceptable solution. But it's literally about the only one.The comment about a crossover or small SUV (why only a sedan) does seem appropriate, though. A few small SUVs and crossovers have an open floorplan. Trucks do as well, as a rule, but most get terrible MPG (15 even on a good day as a rule). The Chevy Colorado gets car like mpg and has an open center console area, though. The Tacoma also does. Both drive a lot like cars now that they have gone to unibody construction. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Hi,Long time site visitor, first time poster. I'm currently trying to decide between a couple of cars I've had my eye on to replace a 95' Acura that's not going to pass inspection due to rust. I would appreciate any feedback I could get on these three options. Below are the cars and the carfaxs.The first is a 2005 Honda Civic EX - 87k miles - $7900CarfaxThis seems like my most practical choice and the one I'm leaning towards most.The second is a 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid - 147k miles - $10,517CarfaxI don't know too much about the hybrids, but I'd like something with great gas mileage since I'll be using it for my daily commute. I'm just not sure about the high number of miles on this car.The third is a brand new 2013 ford focus SE with winter package - $14715The ford focus would be great, and I really enjoyed driving the 2012 as a rental over the summer, but it's definitely the priciest of the three options, and would be pretty tight in my budget since it would come to ~$17,500 after titles and fees etc.. plus it's the most expensive as far as insurance goes. My other reservation is I don't know how good it will be after I have it paid off, I don't want to end up servicing a lot later in it's life (after it gets past 100k miles).Any help with deciding between these and any insight would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!

First decide how much you really want to spend. Big difference between $9000 and $17,500. Then decide if a high-miles older Civic or a new Focus are the only cars you'd want to buy to replace your Acura. There's a LOT of good cars available for under $17,500... e.g. 2010-11 Civics with low miles, some CPO cars. And 2007-10 Accords with low to middling mileage. Or how about this... 2005 TSX, 74k miles, under $13k + TTL? Those are all in my area; YMMV. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

You like Civics. That's good. And you like high MPG cars. Great.There is a Civic for you that does all of that and averages about 60-70mpg. The trick is that it runs on CNG, which sells for half the price of gasoline, or sometimes a bit less. So the equivalent MPG our of your pocket at the end of the day is about 60-70mpg. When you can get CNG for under $2 a gallon equivalent, and it fills just as fast as a gas pump, it's really an awesome deal for someone who commutes every day.You will have to search around to see if there's a filling option in your area (usually at municipal yards, which by law have to allow the public to also fill there, though it's not always the cheapest place). As a bonus, the cars also get carpool access pretty much forever as they are true alternate fuel vehicles.The cars also pollute so little that it's hard to actually measure it with a smog test. In some cases, the air is actually cleaner than the local pollution.  Also, the cars last forever due to there being virtually no grime when it burns (oil looks like new when changed, almost)You can also get a device for about $3000 or so that fills it overnight in your garage. So you become your own gas station and pay about 1/3 of the price of gasoline.The downsides are two. One, it has a 200 mile range between fills. And the trunk is 1/3 the normal size as the tank's back there. Used, they run about 10-15K and are right in your price range. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Why limit your choices to just three cars? If you like the Civic, why not pay a little more and get a newer CPO model with lower miles? Maybe a 2009 or 2010? Not as much $$ as a new one but you will be spending less on repairs than with an older Civic. Whatever you choose, make sure to have any used car checked out by a mechanic before you buy.

I'd like to add that I have a relative that has a CNG Civic and commutes 40 miles each way every day to work. He puts about 20K a year on it and calculates that he spends about $1300-$1500 a year in fuel. In the 8 years that he's owned it, he figures he's saved well over $10,000 in fuel.It drives exactly like a normal Civic, other than having half the range between fills and a much smaller trunk.(about the size of the trunk in a Mini - not useless, just smaller) ","Posts: 3,738",Member

It sounds like you're leaning toward the 05 Civic because it is easier on your budget, at least initially. Nothing wrong with that, and I chose that option recently myself (used vehicle at a much lower price). However, as others have mentioned, you'll want to have it checked out by a mechanic prior to purchase. While Civics are generally reliable, that can vary greatly depending on how well it was maintained, and you'll want to know going into the purchase whether there are any obvious pending maintenance or repairs that need to be done.If the Focus is going to stretch your budget right now, it's probably not worth it. I'd buy used, then sock away as much money as you can to help with a downpayment on a new vehicle in a few years.I'd avoid the Civic Hybrid, personally. We've seen lots of reports about issues with the IMA battery on that model, and some owners have experienced a rather drastic reduction in MPG - if that happens, you won't reap the savings on fuel that you would hope to with a hybrid.Just on person's opinion!

Well, the EX you linked earlier has an automatic transmission and is a sedan.

If the manual vs. automatic and coupe vs. sedan difference isn't important to you, then the LX looks like a better deal for you. High miles for its age, but the Carfax shows that it at least had regular maintenance performed. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

This is not a practical choice for most people. The poster asked about two specific vehicles that both use gasoline. I doubt if one person in a hundred even knows that Honda makes the Civic with a CNG option. For long distance highway commuters, it's a very frugal choice provided there is a filling station in your area. As gas prices climb to $5 a gallon this summer, it might be a bit more appealing to people, though.The original poster did mention a Civic.

If you check online, though, there are almost a thousand stations nationwide. There are also major tax incentives in most states and from the Federal Government. And, GE is working on making a $500 device that fills in your garage. Which means you avoid the gas taxes and other idiocy as well as never run out of gas or have to look for it. Most people don't drive more than 200 miles a day, so it's perfect once at-home fueling becomes the norm. They say it will be ready in a year or less. Then the game completely changes. $500 to not have to deal with a gas station, ever? That's worth it right there.My relative has a CNG Civic. It's OK (not a Mustang or similar - heh), but it costs him $16 to fill his tank. No joke. Not a typo. $16. And he gets carpool access as well. He has to fill up every other day, but it's utterly painless since it's really pocket change and he'd be filling up for $50 every four days with a normal Civic. Plus, he gets some of that ""bling"" factor for being a techno-weenie :P It's a whole other level above a hybrid in terms of being eco-friendly and cutting edge.Repairs? It's a Civic. Enough said  note - the same can't be said for the GM and Ford CNG vehicles, unfortunately. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

I have a 98 Civic with 165,000 on it. So far it has been fairly reliable. I bought it in 2005 at 82,000, and so far there have only been a few repairs required on non-maintenance items. Brakes, tires, spark plugs, and belts are all fairly recent and won't need to be replaced anytime soon. I'm wondering now if I should sell this car for $1,500 or so, and get a newer Toyota Echo at around 100,000 miles (they are going for $4-5,000 right now). I'm wondering if I'm about to enter a period when I'll be needing to put in lots of money to keep this Civic going. When I bought the Civic, I junked the Corolla I had because I would have had to pay some $2,000 to install a rebuilt engine, and I had already put in $2,400 in repairs in the last 24 months for that Corolla. I was thinking that if I had known that I was going to put that much money in repairs alone into the Corolla, I would have sold it 2 years before, and bought the Civic then. What I'm thinking is that I want to sell my Civic before I enter this period of costly maintenance on it. Is it reasonable to expect a Civic to go 200 or even 250 thousand, before everything goes out on it? The Corolla I was talking about had the engine seize up at 250,000, which prompted me to junk it for 100 bucks, rather than fix it. ",Posts: 1,Member

What's the difference between black bezels and beige bezels on the fog lights--anyone have links to photos so I can see the difference?3) I have a few dealers. One gave me a guarantee of the out-the-door price (my neighbor has bought from them and was satisfied.) Another gave me a lower price ($25 less but he's throwing in floor mats & a cargo tray.) Haven't spoke with him yet about a guaranteed out-the-door price (I did a search on car woo, he gave me a price, I called a few weeks later--he's also a zag dealer and contacted him through that--he initially gave me a higher price, when I told him he had submitted to through car woo for a bit cheaper, he said he'd honor the price--a $250 savings.) I've heard horror stories about dealers lying. I don't want to travel a long distance to have the rug pulled out from under me with the price. Any advice? Suggestions? Many Thanks.

#3 It sounds like they're all relatively close on price...but I never buy JUST on that. Find which dealer has the better service dept. Ask questions about loaner cars, timing of service, etc. Ask your friends about their experiences. I'll gladly pay more (sometimes a lot more) to get better service. Yes you can take your car anywhere for service/warranty work but I guarantee you'll get treated better if that service also comes from where you bought the vehicle. Good dealers will go to bat for you to get non-warranty work covered as well, and many require you to have bought your vehicle there to get free loaners, etc. So don't get too hung up over $250-$500 and some floor mats. That can easily pay for itself with better service. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I agree with everything in the first reply. Yes, rubber mats are worth it unless you live in a dry climate! I'll bet the first dealer would throw them in if you asked. I've never had a dealer refuse. Ask about splash guards too. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I'd keep the Civic. Buying a used Echo gives you no guarantees that things might start to go wrong on it either.If it wasn't maintained well you might end up with a few unexpected repairs all of a sudden.Since you owned the Civic for a while you should have a basic idea and schedule on what items will need replacing soon.If it's routine maintenance and nothing major keep your Civic.

Hi all, I've narrowed my choices down between two cars, and it's really difficult to decide.The first car is a 2009 Mazda 3 - 45,000 miles, $12,000 Private Partyfully loaded with leather heated seats, bose stereo, moon roof. Owner insists it has a clean car fax which he'll show me when I look at it. It's also automatic which would be nice since I do a lot of stop and go traffic in my daily commute, and that way my girlfriend could drive it if we take it on a road trip or something.The second car is a 2011 Mazda 3 - 17,000 miles - $12,900 Dealer CarfaxThis is just the basic model, but it got better reviews from consumer's reports than the 09, and it's really low miles which is great! I feel like it'd almost be like buying new. It is a manual, which would be fun, but again driving it in stop and go is killer on manuals and my foot, and forget about my gf being able to drive it. Still I feel like it would last longer and might make the most financial sense. I think it might also still be under warranty (not sure). I'm torn though, the 09 seems really nice and it'd be great for those cold winters we get here. This is why I need advice. Am I being dumb drolling over the 09 while I secretly know that the 11 makes more sense, or would the 09 actually be a good purchase?I'm going to see the 2011 today and have yet to see the 09. Should I see them both before deciding? Any help to sway me one way or another would be appreciated. ",Posts: 4,Member

Did you check with Edmunds that those are reasonable prices for each vehicle? Keep in mind that a manual car is much harder to re-sell down the road. Most people in the U.S. want automatics for just the reasons you mentioned. Sounds like you do too. I wouldn't be afraid of a 45,000 mi. vehicle in this day and age as long as I got it checked out mechanically. I'm not also sold on the idea that the base '11 ""makes more sense"". My son had an early '90s Mazda (manual -- and it took forever to sell it) that had 165,000 miles on it when we sold it and was still running quite well. You'll also have to replace the clutch on the manual down the road; not an issue with an automatic. Get what you want -- they both sound like fine cars. I am a personal fan of features like a moonroof, good stereo, leather and heated seats! ","Posts: 4,677",Member

First off, I'll start by saying that 80%+ of Women in Europe can drive manuals. Your girlfriend can easily learn just like the rest of the planet.( no insult, just that she really CAN do it in a weekend on a modern car)Secondly, manuals have numerous advantages like being able to push-start them in a pinch, starting off in second gear in snow, being able to react twice as quickly to gaps in traffic as you're in the right gear, and of course, the big one, the cost of a replacement clutch is 1/6th of the cost of an automatic. When you're buying a used car, that replacement transmission is not a matter of if, but when. And at ~4K for a replacement automatic in that Mazda, it's a big issue someday.Of course you should go with the newer manual with a lot less miles and a dealer to back it up (the private party should be asking 9K, btw). It also gets at least 3-4mpg better in real-world driving. As for the problem of driving and fatigue in traffic with a manual, it's 100% about driving habits. The skills that we learn when driving an automatic are not too surprisingly, incompatible and different than those which you use when driving a manual. You just need to un-learn the automatic habits that you picked up.A typical driver in an automatic car, because the torque converter is always engaged, tries to maintain a constant distance between themselves and the car in front of them. Also, they tend to ride the brake a lot and have to press on the brake at stop lights. This is all due to the fact that the car will creep forward at a stop or roll on to its favorite coasting speed in that gear. If you don't reign in an automatic, it'll just keep going and going.With a manual, you need to drive like a Big Rig driver does. That is, you pay attention to the gear that you are in and blithely ignore the gaps around you. You do not try to maintain distance or speed down to the last inch, or even the last ten feet. By stubbornly staying in gear as long as you can, and letting the engine wind up and down, you go from having to press the clutch every 5 seconds as you try to match traffic at all times to once every minute or two.The last traffic jam that I was in, I counted. I shifted 4 times in 15 minutes. Most of the time I just left it in 2nd gear and as long as the car wasn't at a complete stop, I could get going again without shifting. Considering that the car had a 2nd gear range of ~2mph-40mph, shifting was optional as long as I left enough space in front of me to to always keep moving.And it also works for higher speeds. Since there is no roll-on effect where the car wants to accelerate slowly (especially true when on a slight downhill grade with an automatic), you can modulate the car's speed quite effectively by just the throttle. I hardly touch the brakes, either, when driving a manual. And, of course, it's different. Even the most bland econobox with a manual is still a bit manly and adventurous and all of that. :shades: ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Surely there's more than these two cars to pick from. The '11 sounds better just because it's an updated car and overall an improvement over the '09. If you're skeptical of the manual, then look around for an auto. You should be able to find something similar without spending much more. These are rental specials and there should be gobs of them to pick from used. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

It doesn't matter that you think manuals are the be-all and end-all. The poster said he/she prefers an automatic. Period. One should get the car that one wants to drive, not what somebody else thinks is the car to drive.I have never had to replace an automatic transmission in any car I've owned. But that's unimportant too. There are advantages and disadvantages to both kinds of transmissions. It comes down to what you prefer. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

My 2 cents: Buy new instead. For just a few thousand more you should be able to get into a brand-new entry-level 2013 with full factory warranty. Financing is very low right now. In the long run, I think you'll be grateful you did. Mazda dealers should be willing to deal. Try www.carwoo.comand make Mazda dealers within 100 miles bid on your business. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Agreed, buy new. Can buy a brand spanking new 2013 Mazda 3 for as little as $15k plus 0% financing. Mazda 2 is $13.5k. Just bought a new 2013 Civic through Truecar (https://amexnetwork.truecar.com).

Thank you all for your responses so far. I went and saw the 2011 today. It was nice, but a little smaller on the inside than what I was anticipating, and this is coming from someone who drove a tiny acura for the past 5 years which my friend and family have dubbed ""the squishy car,"" because it's so small. I think the acura being a hatchback really opened it up. I also got a curveball from my insurance agent who said it'd be somewhat expensive for me to insure versus other makes and models I was looking at (mostly hondas). Anyway, I'm probably not going to go with a mazda 3 now. I'm trying to find something older that will be cheaper to insure, yet still reliable and easy on gas. I'm open to ideas/suggestions.

A good choice if you want something to get around in that's reliable and automatic is going to be made by GM. But what if there was a car that was half Toyota and half GM? GM interior and design, and Toyota engine and reliability.GM and Toyota used to have a joint venture plant in California. They made several cars there:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMIIt's closed now, but the Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe are the exact same car other than interior styling. They are essentially bulletproof, can carry a decent amount of stuff, and get good gas mileage.I'd look at a 2009/2010 Vibe. This is the larger 2nd (current generation) model that looks exactly like what you find in a showroom new from Toyota (bigger and nicer inside). So why get the Vibe over the Matrix? There's a good 10-20% price difference due to ""Pontiac"" being out of business. Of course, the parts are 95%+ interchangeable. And GM actually had more interior trim options as well as Onstar available.2010 Matrix (autotrader)Highest Price:$22,700Lowest Price:$7,700Average Price:$15,4782010 VibeHighest Price:$18,995Lowest Price:$8,990Average Price:$13,893Right in your price range with a little haggling.25/31 mpg highway. My other recommendation would be to consider a classic car. You can get some amazingly good deals on classic and soon to be classic cars. My top pick for something modern is a BMW E36. (92-99) http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/cto/3659727450.htmlInexpensive, reliable, fun to drive, and if it does ever need repairs, you've got a $6K+ nest egg. And it's the real deal. A M3 Convertible in something other than white. It's only going to hold onto its value at this point. MPG? about 20 combined. But it also uses regular gas, which isn't so bad. That 5 mpg difference takes a LONG time to make back. Close to a decade just based upon the initial price difference.Your soul will thank you every time you drive it. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

If size is the issue, why not move up to a used Mazda 6 or an Accord? They are not expensive to insure. After an Acura you would like driving the Mazda 6. It's still on the smallish size but people can fit in the back seat. The Accord is bigger but more dull in the 2008-2012 versions.I have a Pontiac Vibe. It is a very useful vehicle, also extremely utilitarian. If you want basic, no frills transportation, it's a great car. They are sometimes skimpy on safety features. I think ABS only became standard in 2008. So insurance is sometimes higher. We have had very few problems with ours. But I wouldn't want it to be my only car. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Pletko has some great suggestions. The Vibe is a smart idea in used because of the low resale value. For the same reason, a used Honda is not always such a bargain. Recent used Hondas have such high resale value that you might as well go for a new one. Seriously. A dealer with a 2 year old Accord or Civic will probably try to sell it at close to the price of a new one with discounts. So my 2 cents is to still go for new and use the low financing that almost all makes are offering right now.As someone here mentioned, you can usually get a brand-new 2013 Civic LX, which is a bit roomier and in some ways better than a Mazda3, for about $17k. Look at the math of what that would be over 5 years with the 1.9% offered by Honda with a low downpayment.If you're anywhere near Nashville, Crest Honda there is selling 2013 LX Civics for 16,990http://www.cresthonda.com/index.htm ","Posts: 5,952",Member

We have both a Civic and a Mazda3 and they are about dead even actually, with the 3s being a much funner vehicle than my LX absolutely. Both are excellent vehicles with that ""cheap to keep"" mentality...heck, we are over 118k on the Mazda and after a repair of some motor mounts last year, it's like driving a brand new car and the wife won't let me sell it! You can't go wrong with either of them and personally, I prefer the Mazda now!The Sandman  :sick: :shades:  ","Posts: 6,101",Member

I mentioned the Vibe because the 2009-2010 was the new redesigned model. It's basically a 50% bigger Honda Fit. It has 111.5 cubic ft of storage space, the floors fold completely flat (and are coated in hard plastic like a bed liner). You can fit a refrigerator in it. (30"" high items actually fit through the opening)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Matrix_Interior.jpgThose metal strips are rails for tie-downs. A nice touch.The 2008 and older ones are a bit like a Corolla wagon, which isn't bad, really. But the 2nd gen are noticeably better. If we're talking econoboxes, getting some cargo space out of it isn't a bad thing. I don't know why so few companies make small wagons any more. It's a shame, since a wagon is much better overall than a sedan of the same model. And, yes, they do make a Civic and Accord wagon in Japan. We just don't get it over here. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

The effective way to use Carwoo is to counter offer. Since True Car receives $300 from any dealer making a sale via TC, the counter offer should be no more than several hundred dollars less than the TC price.Personally, over the past four or five years, I have found it not difficult to buy under the TC price. Essentially the prices available on TC are set by the dealer and they are designed to intice folks who do not enjoy negotiating. They are really not much different than the no-haggle prices some dealers employ. While such prices often represent a substantial discount off MSRP, they are rarely the best price possible.The best prices are almost always attained via the traditional negotiation process. Negotiations are most effective when they are based on research and knowledge.An effective method to price a vehicle is to obtain, from Edmunds or other on-line sources, the invoice price, the dealer holdback, and the incentives available to both the dealer and customer. Reduce the invoice by the holdback and incentives. Add freight and whatever you think is a fair profit. The result should be our initial negotiation position. The negotiation should start at that price, not at MSRP which how the dealer wants to negotiate.Also this calculation will reveal the true value of the TC price. ",Posts: 27,Member

Your method is very effective, I have used it for years. There are three parts to many car deals. The pricing and financing are the easy parts, as long as the only word uttered in the F&I office is no. The real problem area of many deals is the trade. I think it is very hard to get a real estimate of the value of the trade. My method is to take Edmunds, NADA, and KBB at the good condition level and average the values. I then add a bit if I believe, which we all do, my vehicle is better than average.This calculation at least provides an idea of what I should expect for my vehicle. This process seems to work as I have always gotten close to my number. Of course, almost always, the initial offer from the dealer is a low ball number. ",Posts: 249,Member

The best car in that price range and criteria is likely to be a 2005 Lexus IS300. It's basically a Japanese clone of a BMW E36. It certainly drives almost exactly like one. But it's way more reliable than the newer BMW and Mercedes models. And they made a manual model. The 2005 is the last year of the first generation IS as well, so it's a bit more polished and the issues have been worked out. The IS250 is too soft and underpowered, IMO. The IS350 is basically a Infiniti G35/37 competitor. Great, but lacking that ""sport sedan"" balance that you typically get out of a European car. And the current generation also cost a hefty premium as well. Similar to say, a Cadillac CTS - the first gen models are dirt cheap now compared to the more modern design. The first poster has a much wider range of criteria and a lower budget. That said, the IS300 would also be a good second choice for him as well.http://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?&listingId=33653513- 0This is a typical example. Avoid dealers like the plague in the 8+ year old range as the car usually will either be vastly overpriced or salvaged or have some other issue. And you want paperwork as well on it, of course. Yes, he's asking $2K more for it, but it is low miles and you can haggle.A bit over your budget, but not terribly so considering that you get over a basic Toyota. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

For anyone looking at a 3. I have a 2010 3s that I have owned for 3 years/36k miles. It was an early build of the new body style (smily face). Despite being the first 6 months of the new body style it was build EXTREMELY well. The build quality and reliability of my '10 3 has blown my '03 Volkswagen Golf and '06 Volkswagen Jetta out of the water. Tight as a drum even after 6k miles on horrendous Atlanta in town roads. One warranty repair that was well under $200 and no other issues to report. Coming from a Volkswagen owner this does not mean much, but I have to say my 2010 3 has been absolutely fantastic! My 3 still drives like new, except for normal wear on the leather seats anyone who rides in my car still thinks it is new. Mazda builds some fantastic cars to say the least.

I have a 2013 Altima with 1800 miles on it. I have had it back to the dealer 4 times to have the center console fixed. The problem is not resolved, but a larger issue has taken precedence.Now I have taken the car back to the dealership four times for the heater. When both sides were set for 80 deg, the right blew out tepid air and the left frigid air. The service agent felt both sides, agreed that something was wrong and set an appointment to repair. When I took it in, they couldn't replicate the issue and told me they couldn't fix it if they couldn't replicate the issue. The second time, both vents blew only frigid air until the dail was turned to 88 or 89 deg. At that time the air changed from frigid to heat blast. There was no in between. Once again, I took it in, they witnessed the problem and set an appointment for repair. Again then could not replicate the problem, so they could not fix it. I had them check the records which documented that they had witnessed the problem and they agreed that they had indeed.The service manager then began to explain to me that the new Nissan Altima has a heat sensor that checks the outside and the cabin air temperature and will not kick on the heat or air if the need is not indicated by their sensor.At that point, I threatened to call the owner who is on TV regularly saying ""If it has our name on it, you have our word on it.""Immediately, they provided a loaner and kept my car. The next day, they called to say that they have now ordered parts.  I have driven a Toyota Camry since 1973, each of them had almost 200,000 miles when traded. I have never had a defect or even a repair beyond basic maintenance. I am beside myself with buyers remorse! ",Posts: 1,Member

One possibility is the Pontiac Vibe. It's actually a Toyota Matrix but cheaper. They were made through 2009 I think. We have an '04. It gets around 25 mpg around town. Hatchback with huge space with back seats down and they fold flat. I'd be hesitant about a hitch though. They have enough power to scoot around but I wouldn't want to add any weight to one. They have a super-high reliability rate if you check Consumer Reports best used cars.If you go with a somewhat smaller wagon or sedan than the Outback you will get better mpg. Another possibility is the Subaru Impreza, though the older models don't get very good mpg compared to today's. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I think if you skip the hitch requirement you open yourself up to a much wider range of cars with much higher mpg ratings. Limiting yourself to something that can tow for a possible one-time move doesn't seem like a good move. There are lots of options for moving that might cost you a little more once but surely not enough to offset operating costs in the long-term. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

you can put a hitch on just about anything. But how much you can pull with it will vary greatly by vehicle. Good mileage and towing capacity don't usually go hand in hand since straining a little efficient car with a trailer would be very tough on the drivetrain. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I'm looking for a midsized sedan with these features:Under $26K street price after discountsDo well in new small overlap crash testKeyless passive entry and push button startBackup cameraRear seat HVAC ventsBluetooth stereo streamingRemote startWell controlled road and engine noiseBest possible initial quality and lack of interior rattling and squeaking noises2 cars that seem to best match this are the 2013 Nissan Altima SV and the 2013 Accord EXAdvantages of the Accord.Small overlap crash test results are better (Good vs Acceptable)Prefer the looks of Accord inside and out vs Altima (but not by much).Side view camera is nice.CVT performance is more responsive8 way power drivers seat on Accord EX vs 6-way Altima SVManufacturer's extended warranties are priced about $350 less for top end 8 years zero deductible option (Lower cost extended warranties imply better expected long term reliability).Maybe less depreciation (resale value dollar amount will surely be higher, but real depreciation cost depends on initial purchase price). Advantages of AltimaPricing is better especially since I can buy an SV without an unwanted bundled moonroof that comes with Accord EX (Accord LX and Sport are missing required features in my list). Lack of moonroof maximizes headroom and eliminates a source of rattles and future repairs). Remote starter for Altima SV is standard factory installed vs dealer installed at several hundred dollars for the Accord.Spit fold down rear seat much more convenient than Accord's one piece folding rear seatMaybe a bit quieterMaybe front seats a bit more comfortableMaybe slightly better fuel economyAutomatic backup camera lens washer and blow dryer is nice to clear camera lens when obscured by dirt or raindrops.Headlights turn on with wipersFill tires with air without need of a tire pressure gaugeNissan more experienced with mass production of CVT2013 Altima was released many months earlier than the Accord, so more inline fixes have been done and dealers will discount more since it is no longer so new.Both cars are first year models of new designs and both have had some 1st year issues that are still being worked on (stereo systems that freeze and need the car to be restarted to reset, CVT tuning issues etc). Maybe I should wait for 2014s for either one?I haven't checked on scheduled maintenance and insurance costs yet, so I don't know if one has an advantage over the other there.Anyone here have any opinions on these two specific car models against each other?

We looked at both and eventually bought the Accord. They are wonderful cars and I'm sure we would have been happy with the Altima too. They are so close that I really think it comes down to personal preference and which features matter most to you. For us remote start wasn't as important. We liked that you get the lane watch and right turn camera on the Accord without having to get the nav. We preferred the drive of the accord and the somewhat firmer suspension. The Altima is very noisy when you first start to rev, and after a V6 I felt that would be annoying. Fuel economy is better with Altima though as it is a lighter car. We have friends with Altimas and they are very happy with them. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Have you driven them both? It's not clear from your post....but I agree with others that this comes down to which you like better. I've always been a Nissan fan from a performance standpoint...but they're really starting to flip over to a Toyota model of bland driving. I've NOT driven the new Accord but have driven a '13 Altima and I felt it was a step backwards from the previous model in terms of sporty/fun driving. The steering is too light but I've read reviews that the Accord steering is light also. One big issue for me is resale value, which you touched on. I don't know how long you plan to keep this but the Accord will likely not lose as much particularly in the 1-3 year window. Nissan puts a lot of these on the rental lots which is partly responsible for big drops in the first few years. Assuming the Accord continues their historical trend, they usually hold value very well even over the long-term. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I definitely prefer the 2013 Accord over the 2013 Altima. The Altima is getting blander with each redesign and it kinda feels like it&#146;s trying to morph into a Camry! =/I spent a weekend with a 2014 Accord Sport CVT a few months back (my bro-in-law runs the body shop for a big Honda/Acura dealer and he brought it home for me). I&#146;m still not a CVT fan and I don&#146;t think I ever will be, but I must admit that the Honda CVT is light years ahead of Nissan and any other I&#146;ve ever experienced! I&#146;m just excited that the Accord is a great car again. I&#146;ve owned a few Accords and still have several 2005-2007 models in my family. I despised the 2008 model and it never grew on me. The 2013 feels, sounds and drives like a Honda. Enough said.In addition to the Accord, you should at least take a drive in the 2014 Mazda6 i Touring! It is a stunning beauty, inside and out. Ward&#146;s Automotive just named it to their 10 Best Interiors of the Year and the reviews all seem to range from fantastic to amazing! It&#146;s performance specs are virtually identical to the Accord&#146;s and it has an exceptional 6-speed automatic transmission. The interior looks as upscale and attractive as the outside. A couple of months ago, I had to take our CX-9 to the dealer to have a headlight assembly replaced under warranty. They offered me a loaner and I asked if I take one of these babies....and they did. It was immensely comfortable, as quiet as my 2012 CX-9 GT (which cost almost $40k) and I was amazed by how responsive the new Skyactiv 2.5L and 6-AT felt. I never felt the need for more power, and I have a heavy foot. I was especially impressed by the quality of the interior materials and how well it was assembled. It was rock solid, even over moderate bumps or potholes or bad pavement. The Mazda6 i Touring w/ Touring Tech Package would get you all the features you mentioned above. It would include Push Button Start, Advanced Keyless Entry System, Bluetooth audio and phone connectivity, Rear seat A/C vents and it was a very quiet and smooth ride, even with the gorgeous 19&#148; wheels! It also does NOT have a moonroof, which seems to be a plus in your book. The Remote Start feature is a dealer-installed Mazda Accessory feature. In addition to all that stuff, it also has a lot of other very nice features-Bose 11-speaker Premium Surround Sound audio systemSIRIUSXM & Pandora capable Navigation System Voice Command for Audio & NAV systemsDual-zone auto climate control (w/ rear vents)Auto-dimming Rearview mirror w/ HomelinkDriver&#146;s side auto-dimming mirror Heated side mirrors w/ integrated turn signalsTrip ComputerAnd it also has some impressive and useful safety features--Blind Spot Monitoring System (Accord EX also has, I think) -Rear Cross Traffic Alert (for backing out of blind parking spots)-Rain-sensing automatic wipers-Smart City Brake Support (SCBS)- under 24mph, it monitors for vehicles or obstacles in front of you, the brakes automatic tighten to provide the shortest stop possible, if no driver action is taken, it will automatically brake and cut engine power to avert or minimize a collision-E911 automatic emergency notification- in cash of collision or airbag deployment, it will automatically call 911.There are several other nice touches that also give it a very upscale feel. The steering-wheel, shift handle and parking brake handle are all leather covered, both front visors have auxiliary extensions, front and rear map lights and the center armrest slides to adjust. The power driver&#146;s seat is also very comfortable and has manual lumbar adjustment. According to KBB, it is also the current Resale Value champ. Consumer Reports got 32mpg overall, compared to 31mpg for the Altima and 30mpg for the Accord. IIHS rates it as a &#145;Top Safety Pick&#146; slightly ahead of the Altima, if you dig into the numbers. The Mazda6, Accord and Altima are all within a fraction of an inch of each other in every dimension, but the Mazda6 back seat has a longer cushion to make it more comfy. A Touring w/ the $2k Tech Pkg is currently selling around $25,800 according to TrueCar.com. I just bought a CPO 2010 Acura TSX V6 a few weeks ago, but I still may end up with a Mazda6 before the year is out. Within the next few months, Mazda is adding a 2.2L turbodiesel to the lineup and, if it&#146;s as good as the reports of pre-production models say it is, I may not be able to resist....and I got such a steal on the TSX that I could easily trade it in without losing any money! Then we&#146;d have a CX-9 and Mazda6....time will tell... ",Posts: 801,Member

Yes, we drove both numerous times. I'm a Nissan fan too. Had a Maxima before. I was surprised, but I think the '13 Altima is more mushy driving than my friend's '10. Although its lighter than the Accord it felt like a larger, heavier car. Accord felt more secure on the road. That's just my opinion. Resale is probably better on Accord but we keep cars a long time so not an issue for us. The Max was 12 years old. It was still running well and we got good value when we sold it. But we liked both cars WAYYY better than the Camry we also tried. We agonized a lot over it, but eventually chose Accord. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I like Mazdas too. We didn't look at one because we are hampered by lack of dealer choice and service in our area. It definitely would have been on my list. That was another factor for us. If we move and replace our second car in a few years I will seriously look at a Mazda3. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Both are top safety pick plus rated, but the Accord's score was higher. I noticed the standard screen used for backup camera is bigger and brighter on the Accord than the standard backup monitor screen on the Altima. If you get navigation on the Altima, then the screen size increases. I will have to see this in person to determine if it is a problem.One advantage of fleet sales is that I will probably be able to rent a 2013 Altima somewhere and drive it for a full day or weekend rather than being limited to a 10 minute test drive of an Accord with salesman riding along. 2014 Mazda6 is not really an option because you cannot get all the features I wanted (for instance, proximity sensor passive keyless entry) unless you get the maxed out top of the line model with leather and the crappy 5 inch TomTom navigation for around $31K.Mazda6 is also the newest released car, so it may have unknown quality issues since there are not many owner reports from people who have driven them more than a few weeks and a few hundred miles. Also, probably difficult to get good pricing since it was just released and inventories are probably very low.I'm looking for a car that has every feature I listed with a sales price under $26K after discounting.I plan to keep the car for around 7-8 years and might buy a factory extended service contract with zero deductible for about long. Toyota, Honda and Nissan are the only car manufacturers I've seen that even offer 8 year zero deductible warranties that cover everything except a small list of exclusions.I considered the 2013 Dodge Charger SXT V6 8 speed automatic for a day since that vehicle also had the features I wanted within the price rage (after big discounts plus rebates). It looked like a viable option until I looked at Chrysler's pricing for extended coverage and even at these prices, it had $150 deductible per visit. I think it was more than double the cost of the prices I found for even a zero deductible 7 year 100K mile service plan on the Accord and Altima. If there are massive discounts available on the service plans somewhere, I might look at the Charger SXT again. The fact that the Chrysler service plans are so expensive compared to the Japanese brands says alot about how much they predict will need to be spent on repairs during those years.Chrysler does offer a option of a ""Lifetime"" unlimited mileage service plan for even more money. I guess they are expecting many people to not get full value out of it because they will sell the car or it will get totaled and the warranty will be lost at that point. After 7 or 8 years, I'm not sure resale value of an Altima SV vs an Accord EX of the same mileage and condition will be that much different. Even if the resale value of the Accord is higher after 7 years, that does not make it cost less to own overall unless the difference in resale value is greater than the extra money spent up front on the higher initial purchase price.I have not driven either yet, so if I hate the way one drives or can't get comfortable in the seats or armrests etc or find some kind of deal-killing shortcoming during the test drive, then I will get the other car. If I like both, it will be mostly about the total cost of ownership over 7 or 8 years. ","Posts: 2,697",Member

I just noticed the Tech Package on the Mazda 6 added the smart entry. I thought it was just the nav and you needed a Grand Touring to get smart entry. I don't like the Mazda 6's TomTom-based nav because TomTom map data and routing is poor in the US, plus the Mazda nav has been widely panned for sluggish performance, very limited voice commands and a screen that isn't much bigger than some smart phone screens. I can always simply not use it and use my phone for nav instead as long as the purchase price still fits my budget even including the nav.So, now I will shop the Mazda also and start monitoring Mazda forums to see what kinds of common problems owners have been having, if any. I like the looks of it anyway.I'll check on extended warranty costs for the Mazda also. Even if I don't choose to purchase an extended service plan, I will use the service contract pricing to gauge how confident they are about repair costs it will need during the coverage period.The cheaper the factory backed service contract is with zero deductible, the more likely I will be to buy the car. Less cost and less hassle of repeated visits to the dealer for repairs covered by warranty or not.The one thing I don't like about the Mazda 6 with that package is 19 inch wheels. I don't even want 18 inch wheel, much less 19.It looks good and people buy them for looks without thinking about the consequences.Much higher tire replacement costs.Shorter tread life, so you are replacing the tires more often.More road noise.Bumpier, rougher ride.Massive turning radius like a big truck.Reduced fuel economy.Increased risk of wheel theft (higher insurance?).

19"" wheels would rule that out for me too. Turning radius on both Accord and Altima is excellent. I don't buy extended warranties so that was not a factor. Our dealership has its own warranty program, a nice plus but that wasn't the reason we chose the Accord. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I was just browsing through a Mazda 6 forum and road noise was a complaint that was listed in a likes and dislikes thread.If it is noisy enough to comment on, it probably isn't the car for me.The ""base"" model Mazda 6 Sport has smaller wheels and may not be so noisy on the road, but it cannot be optioned up to even the level of an Altima SV.

The remote starter is another thing that is pushing me towards the Altima. It's not just that it's standard. but it is better integrated.On the Honda Accord, the dealer will charge about $700 installed AND it requires a separate keyfob to use it. I really don't want to carry 2 fobs for the same car in addition to all the other keys and fobs I need to carry in my pockets. One reason I want push start is so I don't have to worry about the weight of my heavy key ring on the ignition slot.I see that the estimated 60 month retained value of a 2013 Accord is 46% of MSRP vs about 40% for the Altima. If I pay a lower percentage of MSRP for the Altima and not have to blow $700 on dealer installed remote starter it could easily be a wash or even in favor of the Altima after 7 or 8 years. I could even get an Altima SV with convenience package and tech package to bump up the backup camera screen to a size closer to the Accord and have the price be around the same as the Accord EX which does not have available nav.I think the Altima purchased at the right price is going to win on cost even after resale differences. I'll only get the Accord if I like it a lot better and feel like the extra cost is worth it. ","Posts: 2,697",Member

Hi folks,I&#146;m in a bit of an odd situation. A friend of my mom&#146;s has a 2010 Infiniti G37 Journey 4-door and her lease expires in a few weeks. Initially, I just gave her some recommendations on certain models to check out and a few good lease specials that also might interest her. But now I&#146;m basically her &#145;wing man&#146; and I hardly know her. She is a very nice, classy, attractive 60-year old...but she&#146;s also quiet, has a&#146;dry&#146; or &#145;hard-to-get-to-know&#146; personality, which freaks me out! My mom&#146;s personality (and mine) are the polar opposite and neither of us ever meet a stranger (but my mom is a total sweetheart and I can be a real smart-@ss)...anyway, the most frustrating part is that she is IMPOSSIBLE to read based on facial expressions and body language. I feel like Agent Boothe trying to communicate with Dr. Brennan on BONES! But she has been very open and forthcoming in answering all my questions about money and a few delicate questions about her future plans and personal life. Long story short- her husband is a jerk and she is planning to leave him by the end of the year. I needed to determine her current financial situation and how a divorce will affect her cash flow. I also had to figure out if she would be open to some upscale cars that may not have a &#145;premium&#146; badge on the trunk!She pays $497/mo for the lease on the 2010 G37. She was expecting it to stay close to same, just not over $500/mo. She cares more about the look, design and function than the brand name, which opens things up! And she drives like a librarian, so she probably has no clue what has been lingering under her left foot for the last 35 months in the G37. So less power is fine also....Her credit score is in the 780s and she owns a Physical Therapy practice that cleared over $200k last year. So qualifying for top-tier deals should not be an issue.I had her do some drive-bys to see several models today-2013 KIA Optima SX-Limited2014 KIA Sorento SX 2014 Mazda6 i Grand Touring2014 Mazda CX-5 Touring/GT2013 Acura TSX 4dr2013 Acura TL &#145;Base&#146;2013 Hyundai Sonata2013 Hyundai Azera2013 Hyundai Santa Fe (both versions)2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 (killer lease deal)2013 Volvo S60 T5So....she completed all of her assignments except she didn&#146;t make it to the Hyundai dealership. But I was surprised (and impressed) that she took notes on all the others!She initially loved the Optima SX-L, but the KIA logo was huge and ugly enough to be a deal-breaker! I didn&#146;t say a word to influence her opinion before-hand, but the KIA emblem is as huge as a belt-buckle and looks cheap! It ruins otherwise world-class designs...and my mom passed on the 2013 Sorento for the same exact reason, so it&#146;s not just me!The Mazda6 was love at first sight! She liked it better than her Infiniti, any new Infiniti/Lexus/BMW or anything else. She saw it in SOUL RED and (amazingly, considering her personality) would want it in that color! If her, dare I say...enthusiasm, continues after the test drive, we have the front-runner right here! I&#146;m curious to see what the lease payment would be for 36mos on a GT.....The Acura TSX was acceptable to her, but she thought the TL &#145;Base&#146; was as boring and ugly as the Mazda6 was gorgeous! She also threw me another shocker- she liked the TSX Wagon best of all! Again, I didn&#146;t say a word to her, but these are all my opinions as well. The TL ranges from boring to hideous depending upon trim level and I would pay MORE for the TSX before I&#146;d drive a TL! I have a 2010 TSX V6, so I obviously love them....especially that Wagon!Honda Accord EX-L V6- kinda plain, but still classy and upscale looking; couldn&#146;t find a single exterior color that appealed to her, but maybe she didn&#146;t see ALL of them....and for $0 due at lease signing and $380/month for 36 months with 12k miles per year, she could learn to like dishwater-dull beige!The Volvo S60 T5 was the other near-ringer, 2nd only to the Mazda6. But all three local dealers have them in one of two configurations- Base T5 with no options in Ice White or Black Stone (the non-metallic &#145;free&#146; colors) OR Premier Plus/Platinum with every option box checked and a $40k sticker price! Leather, moonroof and maybe even metallic paint would do very nicely on the base T5 and keep the price around $33k...but they don&#146;t seem to order them that way....I still want to her to see the Hyundai models, especially the new Azera. I ended up renting one a few weeks ago and, I&#146;m not ashamed to admit, my 38-yr old butt would join AARP right now if they&#146;d give me one of these! Her only two complaints about the Infiniti are the (too) firm ride and low fuel economy. I was very surprised that the new Azera is NOTHING like the previous Azera! It handled somewhere between an old Buick and a parade float, even bouncing a bit after expansion joints on the freeway....the new car is very comfy, but firm and not floaty at all. I also want her to see the entry-level Audi models, perhaps the Infiniti CUV models and (even though I&#146;m not a Lexus fan) we&#146;ll ride thru the lot and see who falls asleep first from sheer visual boredom!What else am I missing??? Maybe the Nissan Maxima? ",Posts: 801,Member

If she likes bigger cars, then the new 2013 Toyota Avalon drives like a luxury car and is much more sleekly styled than last year's design. She can even get a 40MPG hybrid model.If she doesn't need a big car, she may like a BMW 320i or 328i or an X1.If she really likes the Mazda 6 and is not bothered by the road noise on the highway, she could get that and save some money.She might like the Buick Lacrosse or even a Verano is she doesn't mind smaller cars.High trim VW Passat or Passat CC can be nice also.

NEW Development....I&#146;m very seriously considering buying her G37 instead of her turning it back in to the dealer! I&#146;ve never seen the car before and I just assumed it was a Journey with Premium Package, like 99% of leased G37 models. I tried not to think about why she was paying $500/month for it and a 2013 can be leased for $299/mo....but I just got the answer about an hour ago.I had her scan and email her lease contract so I could check out the turn-in requirements and any nit-picking b.s. It stated the car&#146;s MSRP as $44,470 and a discount of $3900 for a Cap Cost of $37k and change after down payment. But the Journey with Premium Pkg MSRP shouldn&#146;t be over $38k...so she sent me a scan of the window sticker....it has EVERY freakin&#146; option available including the SPORT Package, NAV, Tech Pkg.....My mom had said it was Silver, but it&#146;s actually Graphite Shadow, which is a plus for me! It has Graphite Leather with Real Maple Interior Trim. No wonder she thinks it rides too firm- it has 18&#148; W-rated Summer Performance tires, 225/50 on front and 245/45 on rear AND a sport suspension package....duh! It has all of the following-Premium Package-Power Moonroof, 10-speaker Bose Audio System, Power tilt/telescope steering wheel, 2-position memory w/ steering wheel, mirror and seat position memory, Smart Key w/ seat/mirror memoryTechnology Package-Adaptive Cruise ControlFront pre-crash Seatbelt SystemBrake Assist w/ PreviewCollision Warning SystemAdvanced Climate Control SystemRain-sensing wipersNavigation PackageInterior Accent Package-Real Maple Trim on Door Panels, Dash and ConsoleSport Package-12-way Power Sport Driver&#146;s Seat Sport-tuned steering, suspension & brakesSolid magnesium paddle shiftersAluminum pedal accentsViscous Limited Slip DifferentialSport front fascia, side sills and unique sport headlights18&#148; Premium Alloy WheelsP225/50WR18 Performance tires (front)P245/45WR18 Performance tires (rear)The dealer has an identical looking one w/o Tech Pkg or Maple Trim for $28k. Her lease-end purchase option is $20,874 per the lease contract! So I can buy it at that price....right at $22,300 with tax, tag and title. I told her I&#146;d buy it for that and put $1k toward the down payment on her new lease!This is so crazy! I just bought a CPO 2010 Acura TSX V6 on 4/13....two weeks ago yesterday! I love it but it doesn&#146;t have the Tech Pkg (no NAV or Premium Audio) and this G37 is beyond loaded! I was fortunate enough to pay cash for the Acura, so I&#146;m taking it to Carmax tomorrow to see what they will give me. If nothing else, I can finance the G37 until I sell the TSX....I&#146;m going over to her house first thing in the morning (this morning now) to see and drive it! But I can&#146;t see any reason not to go for it! She didn&#146;t even realize how loaded it was and figured all G37s had those features...even though she didn&#146;t use or know how to use a lot of them.....wow! ",Posts: 801,Member

You may need to work something out with a dealer (carmax could probably do it along with buying yours) because most lease buyout are for the leasee only. So in other words SHE can buy out the lease (and pay sales tax on it or however your state works) and then sell it to you (and you pay sales tax again!). But if you work out the deal properly, you should be able to get a dealer to buy out her lease from her and sell it to you at a predetermined price and take your car in on ""trade"". They usually like to make a few bucks on a deal like that (i've paid $300-$500). You should probably find out what she could get on trade for her car and make her whole on the deal. I'm guessing she's got more than $1,000 in equity if she were to trade it in on her next vehicle. Then again...she may REALLY like you and not mind taking care of her sugar baby.....ha!

After talking with two friends in the business (one is the GM at a Toyota dealer, the other is a Used Car Mgr at a Honda dealer), I think I have it figured out.I can add her name as co-owner to the title of my Acura. Then she can trade it in on the Infiniti and buy out the lease and have it titled in both of our names just like the trade-in.When I get the hard copy of the Infiniti title, she and I can go down to the County Tag office and have her removed leaving my name only on the title. If we trade the Acura (which has no loan) I can cover any difference to buy out the Infiniti in cash, so there won't be a loan complicating the whole thing....I already have 1mil/1mil/100k liability limits on my auto policy plus a $2mil umbrella on top of that. That will protect her assets during the time her name is on the title of the car I'm driving. If anyone questions any of these actions, I'll tell them she's my Cougar/Sugar Mama...until we remove her name from the title eventually, then she'll be the Cougar that chewed me up spat me out...give 'em something to gossip about!Trading the Acura would reduce the tax on the G37 purchase by at least $1350, so I'll give the $1k plus $1350 ($2350) to put down on the new lease. If she were to decide to go with an Acura instead of the Mazda, they also have a $1500 Conquest Bonus offer that she could get with her name still being on the Infiniti title....I talked to her just a few minutes ago and told her that it was easily worth $23,500 trade-in or more and I wanted to pay her what she would get on trade-in. But she flatly refused and told me even knowing that she could buy it and turn around and immediately trade/sell it for $3k more, she wouldn't go thru the hassle and paperwork! Did I mention that she made over $200k last year? Must be nice....Besides, she considers my time and effort in finding her the best new car fit and getting her the best deal on it very valuabele. I really don't mind doing it at all, but she seems genuinely grateful for my help! I don't think anyone has ever done that before..... =)So she feels that things are 100% equitable with me paying the lease buyout and no more. She says she won't accept any of the $2350 I plan to give her for down payment, but I told her that I'd be there with her and I'll hand them the certified bank check for $2350 when we walk into the F&I office!!!Of course, it is pouring rain here in Georgia today and thunderstorms for the rest of the day....I'm still going over to look it and drive it, but won't be able to really try it out until the roads are dry....dangit...

I also looked at both cars, but from the V6 perspective, though I did test drive both in the 4cyl models as well. I thought the 4 cyl/CVT combo in the Nissan was very loud and just too busy for me. The 4cyl/CVT combo in the Accord was significantly better, but I just don't like CVT transmissions. I settled on V6 EXL Accord because the gas mileage difference was not that great when upgrading to the 6 cyl car. And i felt the Accord was a bit more upscale than the Altima is. Just my opinion and again, I don't like CVT's. I am a stickler for tracking gas mileage. I have 2,000 miles on my Accord V6 and am averaging about 23 MPG in town and on my one interstate trip of about 200 miles, I got 34.8 going about 72mph. Most 4 cyl cars are hard pressed to match that. ",Posts: 78,Member

Don't know if you can come in under $26k for a V6 though. I agree, Nissan CVT is really loud when it starts up; Accord is much quieter. And the gas mileage is better with CVT. After a V6 Maxima, I felt we could live with a 4cyl CVT. So far no problem. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

The V6 gas mileage is not that bad and compares well to some 4 cylinder turbo cars with similar HP, but the 4 cylinder versions of both of these specific cars do much better with mpg. You would probably get closer to 40mpg on the same interstate trip and a few mpg more in the city with a 4 cylinder 2013 Altima or Accord.Plus, it not just fuel costs. There is the higher purchase price, plus there may be an insurance premium jump and higher maintenance costs over time. ","Posts: 2,697",Member

I agree with you regarding cost. I did have to pay a premium for the V6 over the 4cyl, no question. And it will cost me about $150 per year in added fuel cost. These are all variables that I evaluated when making my purchase. But the added power ans smoothness is important to me. the V6 is very quick and powerful. Ans since I intend to keep the car 8 to 10 years, I felt it was worth the added cost. But again, I drove the 4 cyl and found it very competent. ",Posts: 78,Member

I stumbled on another car that is not meant to be a competitor to Accord and Altima, but might meet my needs for everything listed except the rear HVAC vents. There is a redesigned Kia Soul coming out in the fall that has push start available in an option package in the mid trim Soul Plus level.The current generaton Soul is too noisy buzzy for me, but apparently they really improved the driving refinement on the 2014s and they said it is 3db quieter than a 2013.I will have to wait for road test reviews and my own test drive to see if it is still too loud even after the NVH improvements for 2014. I will also wait for small overlap crash testing and first owners reports on quality issues, but if everything is fine, this could be another option. ","Posts: 2,697",Member

Hey everyone,Hopefully I posted this in the right area. Sorry if I didn't. In any case, I'm going to give you the long story of this question, so you have a better idea of everything. Three weeks ago, I got laid off after 10 months of working at a place and moving across the country (midwest to new england) for a job. Two weeks after that, I ended up totaling my car after an encounter with some deer on the interstate. Since I got laid off, I can't finance a car even though I have stellar credit and I also don't plan on staying around here for that much longer. I'm applying to jobs all over the country, so who knows where I will end up.With that said. I got my insurance check and a little more money, so I'm looking for a car in the 7000$ range at the highest. I can't drive a stick and I would rather have a car over a truck or anything, just because of gas. I also don't know much about cars in general. I can check the fluids and tires, but that is about it. Everything else I'm clueless about.I've spent this entire week going from dealer to private person, test driving, carfaxing, and everything. Looking at craigslist, autotrader and cars.com about everyday. I'm pretty open to most cars, but I keep hearing good things about Hondas, Subarus and Fords.I had a Chevy Cobalt and I never had major issues with it and got to 120k miles, before I crashed the damn thing. I bought it new, but also financed it back in the day. This not financing thing, makes it feels like I lack options, but maybe I'm just not savvy enough at the car shopping bit.So far, I've came across 3 maybes. (I'm not sold on them, so any other suggestions I would love to hear.) All of them are from used car dealerships, which are always shady. For whatever reason, I can't find a decent car from a private person or when I finally get ahold of them, the car is already sold, though it has been a week.Anyway, the first car was a 2005 Ford Taurus with about 87K miles on it. The engine kinda revved up and down slightly when it was idling, but I don't know if that is normal for a ford taurus or if I was looking too much into it. It also had some weird rust spots on the under side, also I don't know what is normal vs what is bad. The dealer wanted 6200$.The second car was a 2005 Honda Civic with 119k miles on it. The brakes where kinda bad, but other than that everything else seemed alright. The dealer wanted 6900$ for that.The Ford and the Honda was from the same dealer, who out of all the ones I've met, has been the most helpful and ""honest"" guy. I don't really trust anyone selling a car, because I've just came across to much bs. But I mean, he said he wouldn't sell anything to me until he delivered me carfax reports (his computer was messing up, he showed me, seemed legit) and he also wanted to do some regular maintenance because the cars were new. Also, when I googled the shop/dealer it got stellar reviews. Not to mention, he said I should take any car I want to purchase to a mechanic of my choice. The fact that he recommended it to me, before I brought anything like that up also makes me like the guy, if that makes any sense.The last car I've came across was a 2003 Chevy Malibu with 82K miles on it for 4200$. The car drove the best, but reeked of smoke. But I mean it didn't idle weird, fluids seemed to check out, brand new tires, overall really nice. Since I'm trying to do research before I buy anything, I told the guy I was leaving and he immediately dropped the price to 3000$. I mean, it seems like a good deal, but it also seems like TOO GOOD of a deal, if that makes sense. He was also hesitant on a car fax report, so I did my own and it was clean, but still, the dealer seemed like a regular slime ball.So that is where I am now. Any advice? Should I continue to look? Anything else I should check out on the cars? I need a car within probably 2 weeks, because I will be moving again. In any case, anything you will tell me will probably be helpful. Thanks in advance!

Civic is probably the only one I would consider. I'm not sure if that's a decent price or not but if it's super clean and brought up-to-speed on brakes/maintenance it might not be too bad. At least that one should be easy to sell down the road if you decide to get into something else. I'd probably also recommend trying to only spend $5,000ish so you have a little cushion for repairs down the road. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I would not consider any of them. You will have much better success if you look at used cars at a new car dealership. Any car you buy should be checked out by a mechanic first. Any car that reeks of smoke will reek of smoke forever so don't buy it unless you have no sense of smell. Check out older Buicks or Pontiacs. They cost less than Japanese makes but tend to be very reliable and are cheap to repair. If you can find one a Pontiac Vibe is a good bet. And yes, don't spend more than 5k because you are not in a position to repair it since you have no income. And as the last car experience showed you, you should negotiate a user car price just as you would a new car. Owning a car is expensive though. Could you get by with public transport until you find a job? In the northeast that might be possible. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Hello everyone. First I would like to say that I wish I would have known this was here years ago, probably could have saved me money long ago. Moving on... I am looking to purchase a used car, I really want a reliable vehicle that needs minimal repairs. I have had the worst luck with cars. I now own a 2005 Chevy Equinox and have had too many issues with it and now want to get something else. I have heard a lot about Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Everyone always says.. they last forever. What does that really mean?? How many miles is too many when you are looking to purchase a used Honda, Toyota, or Nissan?? I don't want to get a vehicle with 100,000+ miles and then have to do a bunch of repairs.Also, of Toyota, Honda, and Nissan which is the best buy, and what models? I would like to stay with and a SUV, but can go back to a sedan. I am looking to spend $12,000 and would like to have it for at least 2 years to allow me to finish school. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you! Laurie ",Posts: 2,Member

If you want the most reliable used brand that would be Toyota! No question. I would suggest a sedan, the Toyota Camry, because it is better on gas. We bought a used Camry for our daughter with 90k on it and we sold it only because she no longer needed a car at 169k. You will have repairs with any used vehicle because parts wear out and have to be replaced, so put some money aside for that. Another good choice that is cheaper is a used Buick, Century or LeSabre. If you want a SUV I would suggest the RAV4 or a hatchback like the Toyota Matrix or Pontiac Vibe. Make sure an independent mechanic checks out any vehicle before you buy. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

There are a lot of reliable makes. Honda is certainly considered one of the best.When I was a student I wasted a lot of time and money by buying used. I wish I had just bought a new Honda to begin with and kept it longer than the used lemons I used to own. If you have $12,000 I think you should just buy a new car instead.Why? Because used Hondas keep their value. You might pay c. $15,000 for a 4 year old Civic LX with 50,000 miles. But you can get a brand-new 2013 Civic LX for c. $16,990 in many markets. And financing is often available. Then, rather than having a car you need to trade or repair in a few years, you can just keep it for c. 10 reliable years and save big in the long run. Or, if you need or want to sell it sooner, it will have good resale value. My 2 cents. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Which do you like driving better? The Avalon in particular should drive differently (e.g. softer, more isolated ride) than the other two.If that's not important to you, all of these should be pretty reliable but the Avalon has the edge I think because 2011 was the first year for that Sonata, and 2008 the first year for that Accord. If the Certified Sonata includes extending the bumper to bumper warranty to 10 years/100k miles, that could be a big factor for you. Be sure to ask the dealer about that. At the least, the powertrain warranty should be extended to 100k miles on the Sonata as a Certified vehicle and you'd still have at least two years and 15k miles left of the b2b warranty.

I vote wholeheartedly for 2011 Sonata SE!Did you happen to check out any CPO Hyundai Azera models? They were introduced in 2006 as a direct competitor to the Avalon....I really like them. The less expensive models have the same V6 that was optional on the Sonata during the same years. The top-end Azera Limited had a larger 3.8L v6 with more power and it is one smooth operator!

My recommend: Get a new 2013 Accord LX. It's better, stronger, faster, safer, gets higher mpg, has blue-tooth, back up camera, alloy wheels, etc., etc. All on the base model.Crest Honda in Nashville has one for $20,292, and Honda dealers in most major metropolitan areas will get close to that.If you buy a new Accord, it's highly likely you'll only have to do minor maintenance (oil changes, mainly) and buy one set of tires for the next 10 years & 100,000 miles. This will simplify your life and save you a lot of time, money, and headaches. You'll save in the long run imho, and have much better resale whenever you do want to get another car.1.9% financing for 5 years is available directly from Honda.http://www.cresthonda.com/index.htm2013 Honda Accord LX2013 Honda Accord SedanEngine: 2.4L I-4 cyl	Transmission: Continuously Variable	City MPG: 27.0 Hwy MPG: 36.0	Ext.

The OP asked about 3 large-ish cars. Actually, the Avalon is a full-sized car, and by interior volume I am pretty sure the Accord and Sonata are also. So a big difference there compared to something like the Corolla and Civic, with their relatively small interiors, and even the Elantra, which at least has a mid-sized interior. I suppose you could ask the OP, what about a Smart car or Fiat 500 too... really easy to park!  ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I would stay away from the 2008 Accord XLE because as mentioned it was the first production year for that particular style. We owned one and the road noise was horrendous. Also the headlights flicker and dim when driving down the road with the 4-cyl. which is a very annoying issue and there is no fix.The Avalon will be a more luxurious car and ride like a lot smoother than the others. If you want sportier driving the Sonata SE is the obvious choice.You should drive each one on the highway to get a better feel for what you would be getting.

I would tend to agree about the first year of production for any vehicle; give them time to work out the bugs. However, drive one yourself and judge road noise. It's all relative. Hondas are not the quietest cars in the class, but they certainly aren't tractors rolling down the road. Trust me, I put 235,000 miles on a '96 Accord and 65,000 on a 2006. However, my 2009 Sonata V6 is the quietest car I've had, for what its worth.Drive one, don't trust me or another random internet poster.

All of them except the Focus are extremely reliable and they all get good fuel economy. I think the main issue is that you drive 2000 miles per month. Which ones best fit your driving style? How comfortable are they and are the features easy for you to use? Have you driven them yet? What matters most to you in terms of features? It's very subjective. For example, I love the audio interface on my new Accord but some people hate it. Do you like a more sporty or more cushy driving experience? Do you find the seats comfortable? Is road noise a factor? After you get some initial driving impressions it will be easier to comment on specific vehicles. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I have not test driven any but I am planning to do so very soon. However, I was hoping to get some feedback from current owners of these models to share what they like and what they don't. Like you said you like the audio panel of you Accord.My most critical points are price, mpg, and low maintenance. Those would be deal breakers. Since this car will be mainly getting me from point A to B, I am not too hard on features. Eg. Having a navigation is not at all a factor.Good audio system, keyless remote (not remote start), quiet ride, smooth driving, and slightly sporty is all I care. Eg. from what I read about Sentra, it's a good car, spacious, but a bit bland. Mazda3 has a good balance of looking sporty plus giving you smooth ride. I hope this gives some more insight.Thanks for sharing your views, suydam. ",Posts: 5,Member

Since you'll be driving these for long periods of time on the highway, you need a comfortable highway cruiser with a smooth ride, relatively quiet, good seats, and of course excellent highway fuel economy. So I recommend you take each of these on as long a test drive as you can, on the type of highway you frequent. Some of them are available as rentals, e.g. Focus and Elantra, maybe the Sentra, Civic, and Mazda3. I just took an Elantra GLS on a ""3 day test drive"" on a 500 mile trip (rental) so I could get a good idea how it would fare in such conditions. It did quite well in all respects, although there was a certain boominess when it hit sharp bumps that would be tiresome if you have to drive on lumpy highways a lot.There was just a small-car review in the June Motor Trend you might want to check out. It included the Mazda3i, Sentra, and Civic but also the Dart and brand-new Forte. And... the Forte came out on top. So you might want to take a look at it. It's based loosely on the Elantra but the EX trim has a more powerful engine with little FE penalty, and I think looks-wise it's a stunner. A well-equipped LX automatic would come in under your $20k limit, an EX just over before discounting. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The US News ratings are based on the JD Power VDS, which rates 3-year old cars. Thus none of the cars the OP is looking at are included in the VDS yet. The Mazda3i is sort of (2010), but has a new powertrain since then. The alternative is the JD Power Predicted Reliability rating. I'll take CR's over that any day. But given all of these cars except the Mazda3 are new since the 2011 MY, there's not a lot to go on for predicted reliability except the automaker's track record. I'd say Honda has the edge there, of these cars, but then you'd have to put up with the Civic, which is no longer at the top of this class as it once was. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I drive these for a living now and I personally would not get the Focus, or Fiesta, for that matter...there are better vehicles out there like the Mazda3 or the Sentra.

I was going to mention the Focus transmission. I know a few people with these and they dislike the automatic and do not get the mileage they expected.

You will have to get a used one to get under your $20K limit but the best option for fuel economy will be a VW Jetta or Golf TDI. It is a good hwy cruiser and handles well. Those diesels are good for 200K+ miles and sounds like a good fit for you. ",Posts: 746,Member

I love Honda design, style, ergonomics. The Civic and Accord both are very comfortable for me and nice drivers.My 3 complaints are pretty indemic to the entire Honda line - 1) They are noisy at highway speed. Mostly in the the rear, and from the tire noise, which is transmitted up through the rear suspension. In the back seat, you can't converse comfortably, it's so noisy at 70mph. The Odyssey is the worst, because there is yet a 3rd seat.2) The Air Conditioning is insufficient, noticeable in the southwest now. Compared to a Toyota or Ford and some GM cars, (but not all), it will not keep you cool on a hot sunny day. That's a deal breaker for me. It's mostly the lack of volume rather than temperature.3) It's a little issue, but the Hondas steer a little too stiffly for my pleasure. Magazines love it, but I like a responsive (which it is), but easy steer. The Noise and A/C keep me from buying one or recommending one, despite their superior looks and cabin design. And, of course, you can't dispute their bullet-proof reliability.My choice therefore? Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion or Mazda 3, Hyundai Elantra. ","Posts: 7,285",Member

Very good feedback so far.. From the messages I think most of you recommended Mazda3 i Touring, Elantra, or Civic.I have noticed the same issues with Civic as nvbanker mentioned. I have ridden older Civics owned by couple of my friends and my wife has Accord, but it's reliability ranks very high.I got feedback from a co-worker who owns older Mazda3 (probably 2-3 yrs). She had good review, except it doesn't do very good in snow. However, I don't think any of the small cars will do any better.Focus is a bit pricier compared to others and it's base model is not that fun. Edmunds' True Cost To Own is highest for Focus.

""The Air Conditioning is insufficient, noticeable in the southwest now. Compared to a Toyota or Ford and some GM cars, (but not all), it will not keep you cool on a hot sunny day. That's a deal breaker for me.""I was a hardcore Honda fan from the day I got my license and owned seven Honda/Acura vehicles in the following 20 years and never dreamed of buying anything else...until I saw and drove the 2006 Civic...and I was devastated because I hated it so much that I had no choice to consider alternatives. The Volvo dealer had a leftover 2005 S40 they were trying to get rid of and it was discounted by $7000+ off sticker. It was white with beige cloth and didn't have a single option, which explains why it was glued to the sales floor. I was very close to signing on the dotted line when I learned that the 2004.5 Volvo S40, 2004 Mazda3 and Euro Ford Focus were built on the same platform. Engineers from all three companies developed the cars together, so it piqued my curiosity about this little Mazda with a mono-numeral name! The moment I saw the 2006 Mazda3 s 5-door, I knew it would be my next car...and I still have it 7.5years later! Of course, I spent weeks researching the Mazda before I was comfortable taking one home. The most impressive thing was the sheer lack of complaints I found. But one issue that was mentioned more than anything else was the poor A/C performance in the Mazda3. I consider cold A/C to be an absolute necessity on any car I own. It can easily top 100 degrees in summer here in Atlanta and, as an insurance agent, I find that soliciting new business wearing a shirt soaked with sweat isn't a winning combo.My MZ3 is Titanium Gray with Black cloth interior. I bought it in 12/2005 and when things got really hot in July/August of 2006, it took 15-20 minutes for the A/C to cool the interior and on the hottest days, the air from the vents was between kinda cool and lukewarm. I changed jobs in late 2006 and the buildinng had covered garage parking. At my previous job, I parked in the middle of an open parking lot, not a hint of shade in any direction and fully exposed to sun all day. I quickly discovered that my A/C always performed adequately if the car hadn't been parked out in the open all day. I finally realized the true source of the A/C problem. Over 80% of 2004-2006 Mazda3 sedans and hatchbacks had BLACK interior! On a 98 degree summer day, I checked the temp inside the car after sitting all day and it was over 120 degrees inside!!! The next day, I parked in my garage and it was 97 degrees outside. My car was a tolerable 83 degrees without the sun baking it all day....Mazda still beefed up the A/C system a few months into production of the 2006 models to compensate, but I simply chose better places to park and never had another A/C complaint!

Pretty much all compacts are noisier than midsize. I think that's a matter of driver preference as to which ones bug you the least. It's not like any of them will be whisper quiet. I never had any AC problems with any car EXCEPT the ones with black interior, so I try and avoid them. I really like steering on the Honda and Mazda, haven't driven an Elantra. Just my 2 cents.

I agree, a black interior is a bigger challenge to cool, and tinted windows helps as well. Personally, I won't buy an all black interior for that - and other reasons (can't see inside them well). Having said that: I have extensive real-world 115 degree Las Vegas experience with virtually all makes and models available today. There are few Fords with weak air (Town Car and Fusion are 2), no Toyotas that I have ever found without excellent A/C, and I haven't found a Honda yet with stellar air. One shouldn't have to park in the shade to be cool. A good system should recover reasonable soon regardless. A Ford Explorer will blow Ice Cubes out anytime, if fully charged, as will any Toyota.Lots of diversity of opinion exists in this topic, because, unlike me, most people have limited experience with multiple cars and makes, unless they rent a lot. A lot also just aren't used to a system that is extraordinary, and think marginal is as good as it gets on a really hot day. Ok, I have beat this to death. Just saying, IMO, if you live below the snow belt, check out the air for volume and chill before you buy, black inside or not. (am I the only one who has noticed that since about....oh....2000, the ONLY interior colors offered are various stages of Black to Gray, and Beige? What happened to the old Blue, Red & Green interiors???) ","Posts: 7,285",Member

Actually, Harvest Gold and Avacado Green (thank God) went out of fashion by the late 70s. They were replaced by 'Country Blue', Seafoam Green, Peach and Mauve. (Excuse me for a moment until I stop dry heaving)My mom's '86 Cutlass Supreme was a great looking car for the day. It was Medium (Battleship) Gray, no vinyl top, chrome rallye wheels similar to the ones on the 442 and raised white letter tires. Then you opened the door and everything was blood red- it was awful.But Honda had an interior color they called ""Red-Brown"" that actually looked nice. It was used in the late 80s Accord LXi and some '90-'93 Accord LX/EX models. I also had a '92 Accord EX that was Frost White with Blue interior....it looked like a smurf had exploded inside the car, but I actually got used to it.Now it's just Black, Gray and Beige or some variation of those on the vast majority of cars. I currently have Black interior and won't even make that mistake again. I live in Atlanta, on summer days when it hits 95 degrees outside, my car is over 120 after sitting parked for a few hours.

Hey pals, I am currently debating between getting a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid from a private party or a 2008 Prius from a dealer. Here are the stats:2003 Civic:Private Party$6200127,000 milesBrand new IMA battery (saw the receipt for it, just replaced last week)Warranty has expiredI inspected the car myself, tires looked near-new, car was very clean, no discernible rust. Everything looked fine under the hood, but I don't know much about cars so I'd need to have a mechanic look at it. 2008 Prius:Certified honda dealership105,000 milesOriginal battery Five more years/45,000 miles left on warrantyCar was incredibly clean, looked near-new. Bitchin red paintSo obviously the Honda Civic is only worth the price because it has a new battery, but will that battery last a long time? I believe the battery that just crapped out was the original so that's ten years, but will the rest of the car even last that long? With the Prius I will be paying a lot more monthly, but I have more peace of mind and I don't have to waste money having a mechanic look at it. I'm gonna be taking out a loan to pay for most of either one, so is the Prius worth the bigger payments/longer loan term? Thanks guys! ",Posts: 1,Member

First, let me say ahead of time, thank you for all inputI've driven a '97 Ford Crown Vic for the last 8 years and it's been great. But it's got maybe a couple weeks left as the rust has made it borderline dangerous. I'm big (6'2"", 250lbs), so getting in and out of a Camry, or similar is really a hassle. Here are my questions:-Domestic or Foreign? I call on all sorts of people at their houses...city people, rural people...is having a foreign car that offensive to some people anymore?-I can't afford new. -Is Enterprise Car Sales a good source to buy from?-For some reason, I've always had, since riding in my friends 2002 Avalon, an infatuation / jealousy of a Toyota Avalon. Roomy, pretty good mileage, etc.,....-How are they for reliability?-Also test drove for a day, a Chrysler 300 C back in 1994, BEFORE they were released, and absolutely love that car. We've also rented from Enterprise Chrysler Town & Country vans for our Spring Break trips to Florida from here in Indiana...and loved them...but was that most likely because they were all too 'new' and didn't have enough miles on them to show the flaws?-I can spend $3,000-$12,000 or so, maybe up to $15,000. However, I don't have good credit (just about 10 pts below 'average' on the FICO score, but our $150,000 house is paid off,s o I guess I could tap into that with a HELOC)...I've never had to purchase a car...always had company cars or bought the CV from family....for $3,000 (his book value) versus the blue book value at the time of $11,800 ...an awesome deal.-Even though I'm experienced with investments, and even worked for a fleet leasing company for a year as a salesman, I'm intimidated by going to my credit union or local independent car leasing company in the neighborhood. -Finally, lease or own? As it is used for work, I think leasing is the best option, and if I do a lease, I'd like to keep payments reasonable. However, I am in a commission only business, so the income flow can be feast or famine.I know, a LOT to digest here...which is why I'm overwhelmed I think. My CV is completely rusted out on the underside, so much so that my mechanic told me he HOPES the car makes it to the end of the month before the front end collapses and would really rather I not drive it at all, but certainly not on the interstate. My rule right now is to do as much of the sales call on the phone as possible, and only drive the CV to go out to get signatures on deals...direct revenue generating. I sell health insurance, life insurance, investment management, etc.,....-Thanks ahead of time for all input. Help! ",Posts: 11,Member

 Where to start. First off, of the repairs likely needed for an older car, a battery is the least of your concerns. There are so many much more expensive parts that will need replacing, like, for example, Tires, struts, and coils. Second, $6200 seems excessive for a Civic with that age and mileage. Check used car pricing for your area on Edmunds and Kbb. Finally, have ANY vehicle, even a certified one, checked out by an independent mechanic first. These are both very reliable cars but you should still get them checked. We bought a certified car awhile back that needed new tires. Not bald, so passed the inspection, but definitely worn.You don't say the price they are asking for the Prius. That could be a good bet because it will definitely be great on fuel economy. But check out its typical used prices too. Did you drive both of them? I imagine the Prius will not sit on the lot very long. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

-Foreign vs domestic really depends on location. Most any metro area nobody will ever say a word. Out in the boonies, particularly midwest....someone might hold it against you. I used to do a lot of consulting work for companies that were GM suppliers...and I always had a GM vehicle available for when calling on them. It was just common courtesy in my book for clients that made up a big part of my income at the time.-Avalon is a pretty good car. Drives as good/better than a CV and very reliable. -If an Avalon is a reliable car...a 300C is very close to the opposite. I see the attraction (big, rwd, comfortable) but I'd take another CV before a 300C if I was going to be piling the miles on. -Reliable transportation you can keep for awhile...I think you can get into something decent for $12k-$15k. I wouldn't go much under $10k and expect much.-Leasing is rarely a good financial decision EVEN if you can deduct the payments. I can make the numbers work on a $40k vehicle where you invest the cash savings....but otherwise it rarely works out to your advantage. You can buy a $1,000 car and write-off $0.56/mile for tax purposes....and that generally is the way to go on sub $25k vehicles. Most of the newer Camrys are also pretty roomy...they've gotten bigger and bigger. I had to spend some time in a Lincoln Towncar recently and I wasn't really impressed with the front seat comfort. I'm about 6'2"" as well but not as horizontally challenged. I find most any SUV to be far more comfortable than a sedan. Also check out 2010+ Taurus. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

I find most any SUV to be far more comfortable than a sedan. Also check out 2010+ Taurus. I'd personally look at a 2008-2009 Taurus or Sable. You can get them CHEAP (since they are the old body style), but actually they have more room and the same powertrain than the 2010 Taurus. Most have Sync hands-free, etc. This car has, by far, the biggest interior of any sedan I've ever been in. You should be able to score a very well-equipped Taurus with under 50,000 miles for $11k-13k depending on equipment. For the record, I'm a big guy (6'5"" 210) and like the car as well. The only thing I'd count against it is the lack of a telescoping wheel on the 2008 model my parents have. ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Their first hybrid was the Insight, in the late 1990s. They debuted a Civic Hybrid in 2003. Battery replacement isn't about whether or not it's faulty, it's about the wear.

See my post (3327) about it. Good cars, decent tech, plenty roomy. Better mileage than a midsize SUV as well. The Taurus involve a good bit more than a name change, although the look wasn't drastically different. They upgraded the engine to the same basic 3.5L still used in the Taurus, a big change from the 3.0L offered in the 500 (60 more horsepower). The Taurus also offered Sync, and improved interior trim.

I just went through the process of choosing a new car (i.e. a used car that's new for me). I thought I'd post some tips from what I learned.The last time I actively shopped for a car was April 2010. Then, I was aiming to lease a good new car for as little per month and out of pocket as I could. And after scouring ads for several days, sending emails and making phone calls, and doing some hard negotiating, I found what I thought was a good deal: $179/month with only first payment up front for a 2010 Sentra 2.0S.Now that car is nearly off lease, and I will buy it out and let my daughter use it through college (it's only $11k; where else can you find a pristine 2010 Sentra with only 26k miles for $11k?). So I needed a car for me. I was going to get a new car, a small hatch like a Mazda3i or Focus SE or Elantra GT, but then I needed to replace the roof on my house. :-( So I reset my sights on a good, inexpensive used car.What I wanted was something for no more than about $7k before TT&L, a smallish hatchback with a stick, fun to drive, good fuel economy, power package, cruise, remote entry, and ABS. Then I checked with my bank, and in order to get their 2.75% financing for up to 5 years, I needed to get a 2003+ MY with less than 150k miles.With those parameters in mind, I started my search, focusing on cars like the Elantra GT/GLS hatch and Mazda3 hatch. I soon discovered that I'd need to broaden my search, as there were few of those cars available, let alone that met my criteria. So my new focus group was: 2003-7 Accord, 2003+ Civic (EX for 2003-5 for the ABS), 2003+ Elantra, 2006 Accent (ABS standard), 2004+ Mazda3, 2003+ Mazda6. (Note: please do not reply with ""You should have also looked at Car-X and SUV-Y""; I like what I like. You need to choose something YOU will like.)Then I spent several frustrating but enlightening days searching for cars, on Saturdays and weekdays ""in my spare time"". A few things I learned:* There are very few really good, inexpensive cars out there. By ""good"", I mean something worth a dealer's retail price (I decided to shop only from dealers, although I did check out some private party ads--didn't see anything to make me take a look.) * Those few really good, inexpensive cars get sold VERY quickly. How quickly? Several times I saw a ""new"" online ad for a car; I immediately contacted the dealer via IM chat or phone--and the car was already sold or had a pending contract. So you have to act quickly if you see a car you like.* The market is so strong, some dealers think they can publish an ad the moment they get the car in trade. Meaning it hasn't been cleaned up, detailed, fixed etc. So you go to drive the car, and it's dirty, beat up (at full retail price for ""Excellent"" condition!), stuff doesn't work or rattles around (e.g. bad front suspension on a Mazda3 that otherwise was a nice car). Some dealers, however, take care to properly prep a car and fix it up before offering it for sale. I was lucky to find a car at one of those dealers.* Be ready to stretch your criteria. I had to stretch mine quite a bit... started considering non-hatchbacks, automatics, more than 150k miles, etc.* Build a relationship with your lender and they'll help you. I've done business with the bank where I got financing for my car for several years--saving account, several car loans. They know me, and know I'm a dependable customer. So when I found a car outside their underwriting guidelines, they still gave me the preferred interest rate anyway.So, after many days of frustration, I decided late Monday afternoon to check the online ads one more time... even though I had already done it a couple hours before. I saw a new ad, for a 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatchback, no photos (ad was really new), 159k miles, automatic, for $4,880. I figured, how great could this car be for less than $5k, but it was for a car I really liked, the rare Mazda6i Sport hatch, and it had ABS, 6 airbags, etc. So I immediately called the dealer and talked to a sales rep. Yes, the car was still there; it was still being detailed but otherwise ready to go. Could I come by in an hour (after dinner) and drive it? Sure. So I ran over there (Infiniti dealership a few miles away) and was introduced to one of the sharpest 2005-anything I've ever seen. Almost perfect inside and out (""traded by a lady"" I was told). Biggest flaw was a hole in the floor mat under the gas pedal (high heels?). Took it for a drive. Drove great, especially for a car with 159k miles. Dealer had given the car a complete check-out (I saw the report) and put in new brakes, oil change, replaced a few bulbs, new Infiniti wipers etc. No leaks. Fresh 17"" Michelins. Saw the Carfax, which indicated regular maintenance at local dealerships. Rest of Carfax was clean. I really wanted this car!Sat down with the sales guy to negotiate. Showed him the Black Book price (a little under their asking price, but Black Book was for ""Clean""--this was more than ""Clean"" and I knew it). After a bit the sales rep interrupted me, politely, and said, ""This car is only $4900. That's the price. If you want to buy one of those $60,000 Infinitis, I'll be glad to haggle with you"". OK. I knew it was a good price. :blush: Left my deposit (on CC), next morning went to my bank to arrange financing, got a check for all but a few hundred $ of the total at 2.75% for 4 years, and went back to the dealership to pick up the car. Sales rep said it would be a few minutes, they were still prepping the car. Holy c*** I thought, the car looked great last night! What else are they doing to it?? When I got to the car, it sparkled. Now I just need a new set of mats!  ","Posts: 18,946",Member

After that, I've let them know they're on their own financially... don't expect anything more from dad and mom (well, probably will need to ante up some for my daughter's wedding), and don't expect any inheritance because we plan to spend it all or give it to worthy causes before we go. My entire college at a private university cost $10,000. Now $10,000 will hardly pay for one semester at the state university my middle child is going to. When he's not in school (including summer classes), he works two jobs. He works part time during school, although he's taking a heavy load of classes to graduate in 4 years instead of the 5 years that is normally required for his major. I'm glad to be able to help him out... as I was glad to help his older brother, who has been 100% on his own financially since he graduated. And as I'll be glad to help my daughter.And BTW... I love driving that 2005 Mazda6i Sport. It's a heckofa lot better looking than the Sentra. Handles great. Flexibility of a hatchback. But it has 160k miles on it. I'd rather have my daughter drive the more reliable car, one with better FE to stretch her gas money more (she works, but doesn't make quite as much as I do), one that's easier to park. A car that will last her through college and beyond. It's my money, and I can do what I want with it.FWIW, the Sentra is mine until my daughter graduates from college... then I'll give her the title as her graduation gift. The car will be 8-9 years old then. Until then, it's my car and if she wants to use it she does so under the rules my wife and I set for her. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

(it's only $11k; where else can you find a pristine 2010 Sentra with only 26k miles for $11k?). Just because I'm that curious, I did find that you can in-fact buy a 2010 Sentra with less than 40,000 miles for under $12,000, retail. This is before dickering. However, there's a lot of comfort in a car that you drove and maintained as opposed to wondering who might've abused a used car. http://www.getauto.com/2010/nissan/sentra/sedan/new-york/grand-island/2010-nissa- - n-sentra-details_40641732 ","Posts: 9,731",Member

New York, eh? Not too bad, only about 1000 miles away from me. I just did a search within 500 miles and found one 2010 Sentra for sale under $12,000, a base model with CVT with 29k miles, for only $10.7k. So if I'd like to step down to a base model instead of an S, get a car with more miles on it, and have an uncertain usage and service history, plus go all the way to Chicago (800 mile round trip) to get the car, I could save a few hundred bucks.Or I could drive 6 miles to my local Nissan dealer, give them a check, and drive away. I think I'll take that route. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Backy's Sentra sells for about $9,700 at the Manheim auctions nationwide every day. If you turn your leased car back in to the dealer at lease end under or at miles, they in turn give them back to the lease holder, who normally puts them in the auction. They are betting they can get the residual balance out of them at auction. Roll of the dice, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. They can set a floor price of what the minimum is they'll take for the car, but also with that, risk not selling it and being stuck with it. But they will always get that residual back from the owner if he/she is willing to buy it at the end of the lease for the carefully projected residual value. However, that's not usually a good investment.Understanding that there is value in you being the only prior owner, you have to decide if that's worth $3000 to you (in this particular example). If you know a wholesaler (as I do), they can buy the same car back for you at the auction for that $3,000 less (minus their fee, if they're not your friend). I do that fairly often for friends - buy their car back from the auction for them. They just lose possession for about a month while the car cycles through the snake.With this access, I never buy my car out of my lease - I let the lease holder take that loss. And that's what the dealers do as well, when they buy your car for their lot. No smart dealer every buys a lease return directly from the lease holder - they buy it later from the auction if they want it. The 2 primary sources for a used car lot are trade ins they like and keep, or auction cars, ie; rental returns, lease returns, repos & other dealer cars they can't sell, and put through to ""blow them out"", as the vernacular is.

I don't know a wholesaler. I would have no idea how to go about arranging to have a wholesaler locate my car at an auction, buy it, and sell it back to me, and ensure I'm the one who ends up with it.The way I look at it, there's nothing out there in a comparable used car for this kind of money... except at auctions of course. I don't shop at auctions. Good for you that you have that insider info. So if I don't buy this car for $11k, what will I get? Something with a lot more more miles, or older? No way to tell how it was driven? No, thanks.P.S. In this example, we are talking a max of $1,300, assuming my car would go for $9,700 at an auction. Not $3,000 difference. Also, if I don't buy the car at end of lease, I owe a termination fee. So it's really less than a $1,300 difference. Plus there's that auction fee you mentioned--how much is that? Also, when a car is purchased at an auction, is sales tax paid on it? How would this transaction work? Would there actually be two transfers of ownership here--auction to my agent, then agent to me? If so, there would be two rounds of sales tax paid.By going to the dealer, I keep the car in my family all the time, I ensure I get to own it (slip ups can happen at an auction, no?) at a certain price.And I am not so sure the dealer wouldn't keep a car that is 13,000 miles under the normal mileage for this term lease and in pristine condition to sell themselves.

They won't, if they can get it for much less at the auction and then sell it for more profit. Be sure, I am one. Well, there are idiot dealers I suppose.

So when a dealer advertises a used car as ""we took this in as a trade on a new car"" (I see that a lot in ads), they're lying? And when I saw a 2007 Rabbit I traded in on another car for sale by the same dealership a couple of days later... they were able to turn that around through the auction process that fast? Or maybe this was just one of those ""idiot"" dealers, who's been in business for only... a couple of decades, in this case.I learn something new every day!""slip ups"" can happen anywhere, anytime.Thanks for validating my strategy to buy the car from the dealer, to ensure I end up with it.

I think you may be confusing a trade-in with a lease turn-in. When you traded in your Rabbit, the dealer would either put it on his lot (as he did in your case) or send it to auction if it didn't fit his dealership, such as if you traded in the Rabbit to buy a Mercedes. A lease turn-in is different. nybanker is saying that rather than pay the residual to the leasing company to buy the car, chances are he could acquire the same model at auctiion for a lower price should he want that model of car on his lot. A perfect example is my 98 A6. It had a 63% residual but although I turned it in with over 10K miles remaining, the dealer sent it back to the leasing company because they were selling for only about 55% of original MSRP. He had plenty of 98's on his lot, but he acquired them at auction or thru trade-ins. ",Posts: 47,Member

I've been offered a fleet 2010 Equinox LS from a major well respected company with 74,000 miles for 11,500. No problems, well maintained by strict maintenance guidelines. They have their own shop as well. This was driven by sales guys. Right now they have around 20 for sale as they just bought 2013s. Currently I have a 2009 Camry SE loaded with radio, sunroof, wheels, tint....etc with 69,000 miles. I've had it for 8 months, and its just okay. More stuff than I need and I'm tired of the ground effects. I'll sell the Camry for $13,000...I hope, and the equinox prices at $16,00, but I'm getting it at $11,500 as part of employee plan.

Got an email from my Nissan dealer on June 19 (Wed.) that they just received a 2014 metallic blue Nissan Versa Note with the Convenience package. Drove 50 miles to the dealer on Thur., test drove & decided to sign the papers to trade in my 2007 Mini Cooper. I picked up the new car the following Monday. After a week, it has been very nice. Admittedly, it does not handle as well as the Mini, but it is more comfortable in town and on back roads that have seen the ravages of winter weather. As a small person with shorter legs, the seat bottom is just right. One reviewer complained about the seat not supporting his thighs. But he is 6'1'. So this aspect rules out all the full-size and most intermediates for me.Lots of rear legroom. With the seats folded, I can put in my bicycle or our big dogs. There is enough room for us to take a trip. Acceleration is quite adequate. The CVT is smooth. Visibility is as good as any car I've had. The rear view monitor works well while backing. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, meaning I can reach the dials while keeping my eyes on the road and adjust by feel. It is quiet and acts predictably. The only complaint that my wife has is the lack of an armrest on the passenger side.It came with low rolling resistance tires. I wonder if getting better tires will improve handling, but at the expense of mileage. So I am no longer waiting for the 2014 Kia Soul & Forte 5-door.For my retirement next year, now I have a new car, a new horse and a new saddle. I gave one bicycle away. So now I only have five. What else? ",Posts: 75,Member

Sounds nice...this is the replacement for the Versa HB, right? My kid had an '09 and I really like it as i can slide right over in the seat and with my spinal issues, this is wonderful. Your new vehicle sounds perfect for you guys and good luck with it and it is the perfect retirement vehicle! Retired here also and plan to replace my current Civic by the 2016 or 2017 model year since it's an '06 model. The newer one will probably be my last vehicle but I keep going back and forth between staying with an economy one or spending a bit more and going for an entry level lux one. I have no problem with a cpo unit as I know a new one would be out of my price comfort level and these days, cpo units can be the perfect alternative for someone in this situation. Finding what I want within the parameters I will have set up will be the issue but I'm quite confident that there is the perfect vehicle out there when the time comes. I want to reward myself for all my hard work over my career with something nice that will give me years of enjoyment...and I do deserve it!Starting sometime in latter 2016, my quest will begin!The Sandman  :sick: :shades:  ","Posts: 6,101",Member

I would exclude anything before the early 90s due to lack of airbags. You might be able to get a 90s Mazda Protoge (3 predecessor) for that much money. The issue you will have with all of them is that they will need some fixes - you will have to budget for that. For availability of parts and reliability I'd lean toward the Hondas. The family had a 90 Civic and was very reliable in terms of drive-train - but it went through 2 mufflers and one paint job in 15 years. ",Posts: 746,Member

I am very satisfied with the Nissan Versa Note I bought a couple of weeks ago. Here are a few things that car manufacturers and dealers need to keep in mind with short people with small feet. And for short drivers to notice.1) Gas pedal placement. Some cars are easier to drive for me because the gas pedal seems to be closer to the floor and is easier to reach. On some cars, especially larger cars, in order to better control the gas pedal, I have to essentially drive with my heel in the air. I cannot pivot my foot with my heel on the floor. This is tiring on longer drives in heavy traffic when using cruise-control is not practical.2) Controls are too spread out so that I cannot reach them unless I take my eyes off the road and look at the dash.3) Seat bottom size. Especially in larger cars, the seat bottom is too long so I essentially have to put a cushion behind my back so I can bend my leg at the knee to reach the pedals. 4) Driver seat too low. This is especially true of larger Fords and Chevrolets. It is hard to see the road over the hood.5) Tailgate height. On larger SUVs, the tailgate opens too high that I cannot reach the edge to close them.So the manufacturers essentially shunted me toward their compacts and subcompacts. ",Posts: 75,Member

Definitely get the 2013. I own a 2013 Accord EXL navi and it's by far the best car I've ever owned. I also own the previous generation. It was a good car for its day, but it's slower, doesn't get as many miles per gallon, has much more road noise, etc.In terms of the model, the LX for 2013 has a lot of things that used to be on only the higher end models&#151;like alloy wheels, bluetooth, advanced direct injected engine, etc. This model is a great deal. My parents have one and they love it.EX adds smart entry among other features, which is really cool. You don't get your key out of your pocket. You just approach your car, it knows it's you, and it unlocks the door. You press a red ignition button to start the car. The EX features are worth it in my opinion. But if you want to save $3000, the LX is still a great car.I'd take a 2013 LX over a 2012 EXL.The new model gets about 3-5 more mpg, and gets to 60 about a second faster. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

EX adds: 17"" Alloy wheels, V-rated tires, Power Moonroof, Smart Entry/Push button start, Lane Watch, deluxe fabric seats, fog lights, heated side mirrors with turn signal indicators, 2 more speakers for the stereo, driver and passenger auto up/down windows, lockable glove box, etc.EX CVT lists for $25,405+790 destinationLX CVT lists for $22,480+790I'd say the Moonroof is worth about a thousand, the upgraded wheels and tires are worth maybe 600, the smart entry/push button start is worth maybe 800, the lane-watch 800, and the other stuff maybe a 600 more. So it seems worth the $3000 difference, but none of this stuff is absolutely essential if you want or need to save some money. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

One and only one thing matters here, and that's age. Almost any car built after 2000 will be decently reliable for a first car. So the trick is to see what you can get for that much money.1 - Put that $2500 down on something better and make payments. Unless you have garbage credit, that's at least a $5-$10K car. That gives you real options. $2500 will get you a bucket of problems and nothing good. In fact, if you have $2500 and that's it, you need to be looking at old semi-classic or classic cars, hopefully something that is pre-smog so that it's screwdriver and a wrench simple to fix. Modern cars since about 1990 are simply too full of electronics and sensors and other idiocy to be good past about 15 years. One throttle position sensor goes out and it's $250 to fix. Then there's tires, a possible transmission, things like water pumps, and so on. A 15-20 year old vehicle is penny wise and pound foolish as the adage goes.Classic cars are the only exception to this rule. 2 - Your best bet will be cars that are over-built and have image or dealership problems. Anything by Pontiac comes to mind immediately because the brand is gone. There's nothing wrong with the Grand Prix, for instance. It just isn't new or exciting and all of that. So you can find them for almost nothing. Reliability is fine if you get one with the 3.8L engine, which was a mainstay of the GM fleet.Buick, Ford, and other domestics also are good bets. Don't be afraid of a rental car, either, if it's in good shape and is a big boat. You can't kill a Crown Vic, for instance, short of driving it 250K miles as a taxi or as a police car. Buick is also a good brand, btw.3 - Look at what you relatives have and consider possibly buying one of their old vehicles. You can skip smog and taxes with a family transfer. This can give you more money and a usable history as well, so IF you must drive a beater, at least it's not a total surprise. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Resale value -- for a car you bought for under $2500 -- Not a consideration. Any car that runs by then is a bargain. Main factor would be cheap parts because you will be replacing some.

People always overlook SATURN, even before they went out of business! The mid-size L-series can be a very good, safe, cheap car but only with the 4-cylinder- the V6 (shared with Caddy Catera) can be a hellish nightmare!The '07-'09 Saturn AURA was and is a great car- it's a twin to the Malibu, but better looking inside and out.The '05-'07 VUE compact SUV can also be a great used buy if you stick with FWD and the V6 (a Honda-supplied 3.5L). The '09-'13 Mazda6 is one of the best cars that nobody bought??? So they can be a steal used, but avoid ones that have been rental cars.The '06-'10 Hyundai Sonata and Hyundai Azera are both great deals and the '07-'10 KIA Optima is also a great car, but ABS was optional and I wouldn't buy a car without it.

I drove a '12 Mazda6 last week and was very impressed with the way it drove...very smooth and the engine begs to be driven! Even my co-worker, who I whizzed by, commented about how fast I was going and I just told him the combo of the engine and the accelerator just begged to be floored...which I did! Just can't wait to get one of these puppies on an extended trip as I drove one up from Miami airport to Lauderdale airport which is only about 20 miles or so, not nearly long enough to enjoy such a vehicle. Personally, I enjoy the longer trips that we take because once I get comfortable in something, I'd rather drive for awhile but lately, many of our gigs have been local. Like last night, we got a last minute gig to take vehicles from Lauderdale up to West Palm at 7 p m. I lucked into a Sonata and it was sweet! I would've loved to take it out for a Key West or Orlando run to get some good seat time in it.

What year Maxima did you have? I had an '01 and it was outstanding in reliability. I just sold it and the people who bought it love it too. The only thing not outstanding about it was premium fuel and fuel economy, so I just bought a new Accord. The old Saturns are probably better in that regard too. Are parts still easy to get for them?

It was a 2000 Maxima. It had CEL problems with coils replaced early under warranty. Later on a couple of power window motors and a few rotors. But it was a reliable car that we had 8 years with only about 70K miles when we sold it privately. At that time the silver paint was getting dull (I waxed it often)The top of the line Saturn Aura XR with the 3.6 was $3000 cheaper than the Maxima was 8 years before. It is quicker than the Maxima on reg. gas and gets 31 mpg on the hwy, bettering the Maxima's best of 30. The ride is smoother, The cabin is quieter and it has more options. The steering shaft and a door lock actuater have been replaced under warranty. Both are common issues with these cars. It runs great, does not burn a drop of oil and overall we are happy with the purchase. Also after sitting outside 5 plus years the white paint and chrome (plastic?) look as good as the day we bought it. The interior leather is wearing very well too. ",Posts: 480,Member

""No problem - I have overlooked Saturn from the day they were born. I could go on and on about the reasons. Bob Lutz puts it best in his book - He threw up when he saw the design sketches for Saturns.The original Saturn models were outdated before they even built the factory! They used the Civic and Corolla that were introduced in 1984 as the benchmark they were shooting for...but the cars didn't hit the market until 1990. When the 1992 Civic debuted, it made the 1992 Saturn SL seem closer to a Yugo or Ford Festiva than an actual competitor. The S-series Saturns were also downright homely looking. Yes, they looked unique, but not in a good way. They loved to talk about those polymer body panels and how durable and dent resistant they were, which was true. But they also had huge panel gaps (required due to the body panels expanding and contracting with temperature changes) but the huge gaps were rarely even. I remember test-driving a 1991 SL2 just to see what the fuss was about. The hood was so misaligned that I could fit a thumb in the gap on one side and barely fit a pinky in the gap on the other side. The trunk lid was just as bad. The interior was almost as bad with poor fit and finish anywhere you looked. And don't get me started on the quality of inteiror materials....I've used Solo cups that felt more substantial.Then there was that pinnacle of mechanical engineering under the hood! They design a brand new engine from scratch so it would be world class and highly competitive- an 8-valve head and Throttle Body Injection was definitely the way to go! It made 85hp and with the A/T it could hardly get out of its own way even at full throttle. But few owners ever floored the throttle because a potential crash and possible injury or death was preferable to the 'gravel in blender' sounds of the engine past 4000 rpm. Then there was the DOHC 16v version in the SL2 good for 124hp and actually pretty quick for the time. But the engine sounded even worse than the weakling version and caused so much vibration that interior parts started buzzing and it was almost impossible to refrain from taking your hands off the steering wheel as it vibrated in front of your eyes! Perhaps they felt balance shafts didn't fit in with their 'all-new' different kind of car company b.s.??? Saturns reallly didn't become decent (some even rather good) cars until GM went back on their word and started badge-engineering and stealing cars from their European division to rebadge. Instead of creating a new division to attract import buyers, GM could have used the $5 billion to improve their existing models. I wonder if they ever questioned why import buyers didn't like the cars they were already building??? Or did the combination of ignorance and arrogance prevent rational and logical thought? Regardless, it's all history now. But I do find it amusing that almost 50% of Saturn buyers weren't import shoppers- they would have purchased another GM brand if they didn't get a Saturn. So half of their sales were stolen from themselves! ",Posts: 801,Member

Saturns seem very popular in the Twin Cities, and I still see a lot of them rolling around, especially the SLs. I expect the polymer body panels were the attraction here in the Rust Belt. I liked the SCs, almost bought a used one a few years ago but decided to pass. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Hey everybody, I'm Chase and I&#146;m an inexperienced car shopper on the hunt for a used Civic in Portland, Oregon. It is a purchase I&#146;d like to make in the next 6 weeks (though I&#146;ll wait longer if I have to) and I&#146;m hoping that you all can share some of your wisdom with me so that I make a smart purchase. Here is the lowdown as far as budget and needs are concerned: Budget: $7,000 is the absolute ceiling and ideally it would be from a private seller. Wants: Most importantly I want to be able to drive it for up to 60,000 miles hassle free. These would be easy city miles and I&#146;d expect them to come over the course of 5-7 years of driving. I would like it to be a 4 door sedan with good to great gas mileage (30+ on the hwy would be nice), and, as far as amenities are concerned, cruise control would be nice but A/C is essential. Primarily I am looking to know what model years to look at or to stay away froom; more specifically, with regards to my hope of getting 60,000 miles of hassle free driving out of the vehicle, I'm hoping to get some insight about what my cutoff point for mileage on a prospective purchase should be or how I might change my preferences to something more realistic. Another question that I have been wondering about in the past few days: Should I expect to pay more than edmunds appraisal values for a vehicle?Thanks in advance! ",Posts: 79,Member

For that kind of money and a private party sale you can most likely get something in the 2001-2005 Civic generation, LX 4-door (with cruise and AC), with 100k miles give-or-take some. If you keep it 5-7 years, it will be at minimum 13-15 years old when you're done with it, with 150k+ miles at least.Odds are something will break or wear out while you own it. That's the down side of driving a well-used car. The best years of such a car are behind it.Not long ago I checked out a 2003 Civic EX 4-door that looked great inside and out. Had 120k miles. The dealer selling it had done a lot of work on it before putting it on the market. But when I test drove it, the clutch made a popping sound. So I passed. They wanted $6800, which I thought was too much for a 10-year-old Civic with 120k miles and an unknown problem in the clutch/transmission.I wound up buying a 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatch with 160k miles for $4880. Great condition inside and out, everything worked... for a few weeks. Then the alternator started failing. Repair shop wanted $500 to replace it. (I bought the part on the Web and had a friend who's a good mechanic to put it in for me: total cost $160.)The Civic will be as reliable as any other $7k car you can buy, but don't expect to put $0 into it for 5-7 years of city driving.

A Civic is a good choice and they are generally reliable year after year. Are you limiting yourself to just that model? Consumer Reports annual auto issue has a section called ""used vehicle best bets"" that is worth looking at. They also have reliability stats on each model going back several years so you can find out if there have been problems with a particular year. They also list prices you can expect to pay so you can get idea of a good amount to offer. As others have said, you will have to do some repairs on even the best used car. A car 10 or more years old will have parts that wear out. It is imperative that you have a mechanic check out a car before you buy it to make sure it is in good working condition when you buy it. Good luck! ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I agree with backy's thoughts here. A 10 year old car with nearly 100k is going to have some expensive repairs over the next 7 years. If you have $7000 now, how about this: get a brand-new 2013 Civic LX for c. $17,500. For only a little bit down you'll have payments of about $300 a month. A new Civic is likely to have at least 7 years of almost trouble-free driving, with only regular maintenance. And at the end of seven years it'll probably have a resale value of c. 7000 or so. With a 10-year old used car, you might have repairs of as much as 3000 or more over 7 years. In other words, the cost might actually be about the same in the long run, but rather than driving an old car that'll probably cause you considerable trouble you'll be driving a new car that's faster, safer, more reliable, and gets better mpg.You local Honda dealer (or Toyota or Hyundai etc ) wants your business and has low 1.9 factory financing available if you have good credit.My guess is that you're in your 20s. When I was in my 20s I bought used car after used car, another one every 5 years or so, and each one had significant repair and maintenance issues that cost $$$. Looking back on it, I think for the same money I could have been driving a new car and keeping it longer.Just my 2 cents. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

The Civic is a good choice if you want to look at just one model. The library sometimes carries Consumer Reports issues; the April issue is their annual auto issue. Edmunds also has good info on used cars as does Autotrader online. Toyotas are also good choices, especially the Corolla. One you may not have considered is the Pontiac Vibe, a hatchback which is actually a Toyota Matrix but cheaper because it doesn't have the Toyota nameplate. I have one and it is like the Earthshoe of cars; just keeps on going in its plain solid way year after year.If you look at a hybrid consider how old the battery is as they are very expensive to replace. You will probably be able to get a newer gas model cheaper and they get good gas mileage too. Tom and Ray, the car guys, say that as a rule of thumb you should expect to put $1000 per year into a used car. Maybe not every year but there will be some years when you do. So put some $ aside for the inevitable repairs. That's still less per year than a $300/month car payment. Insurance is less too. When I was in my 20's I couldn't afford a new car payment and we had used cars for years. My kids did too. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I rarely give absolute, black-and-white advice, but I'm going to this time:DO NOT GET THE CIVIC HYBRID.If you have to replace the hybrid battery during your period of ownership, which is almost a certainty, you are looking at thousands of dollars. The model years you would be looking at also had some issues, one of which caused degradation of MPG, so you would have a problem vehicle AND you wouldn't be reaping the benefits of fuel savings. Just enter ""Civic Hybrid"" into the search box on the left of this page and you can find a list of discussions about that vehicle, most of them with the word ""problems"" in the discussion title.

Benjamin has a good point here. Even a lease might work. A 10 year old Honda civic will not be worth much in 5-6 years from now not to mention the repairs you might face. Bethpa over in the civic lease thread just leased a couple of LXs for a around 200 a month with zero due at signing. You could use your $7000 fund for the payments. Honda leases are very customer friendly - includes gap insurance, $1500 wear and tear waiver at end of lease and you have the option to extend the lease up to 24 months if you wish at the same payment (they adjust the residual accordingly). I only offer the lease option because you stated you won't be driving many miles. Bill G ",Posts: 699,Member

Some years might be $500, but other years might be $2000, and the average was probably around a thousand. But that might be another argument for new car. If you spend 7k on a used car and spend another 7k in maintenance and repair over the next 7 years, you're out 14,000, and at the end of it you have ancient car with almost no value.If you instead start buying a new car, at the end of 7 years you'll still have something that's worth a good deal, and you can either trade it in or keep driving it. For many new cars, all you'll basically just need to do are a lot of oil changes, and probably a set of tires, but maintenance and repair costs will almost certainly be very low and quite predictable. Your time and stress levels also are worth money. The stress and the hours at repair shops I used to spend with old cars was worth something to me in cold, hard cash, even if I was never paid for it. To be almost free from those annoying hours spent in that way with a new car is a positive dividend that's worth a good deal imho.Again, just my 2 cents. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

gmanusmc has a good idea about looking into a lease.No matter what the brand, it's a good time to buy or lease because car dealers are clearing out the last of the 2013 models. You should be able to get a good deal. Try this site:www.carwoo.comThere are other, similar sites that are probably just as good.

Thanks a lot everyone, I'm absorbing a lot of information here.I'm a pretty frugal money conscious kind of guy so my initial impulse when I hear ""purchase new"" is ""OMG no, depreciation!!!!"" but I do see that a used car can end up costing the same, if not more. Essentially, my goal, is to have the most reliable vehicle possible, while incurring the least overall cost (duh, who has any goal other than that), to that end, and thinking along the lines of the reason people are suggesting purchasing new, why hasn't anyone recommended purchasing something 3 or so years old from a dealership?

Agree with gm 100% here. If you're going to get a 3-4 year old Ford, GM or Chrysler, sure, go ahead and get used. Probably that's better than a 10 year old Honda. You also might be able to get a 3-4 year old Hyundai or Nissan at a good price.But if you're fixed on Honda, and as a big Honda fan myself I can see why, then getting a 3 year old Honda in tip-top shape (""Certified"") doesn't get you much of a discount compared to new. And by 3 years your bumper to bumper warranty has expired. And yes there's depreciation, but the first three years in a car's life are almost always its best and most trouble-free years.

As a self-described cheapskate, I find myself agreeing with what others are saying here, particularly since you initially talked about keeping the vehicle for 6-7 years, and that was gonna be a mostly-used-up used vehicle. So, if you can keep a semi-beater for 6-7 years, surely you can plan to keep a brand new vehicle for at least as long, if not longer, eh?One advantage to owning it from new is you get the full length of the manufacturer warranty (some of the longer warranties don't transfer in full to the 2nd owner), and you will know how it's been maintained (hopefully very well) and cared for. Then, once you're finished paying for the vehicle, you'll have that uber-pristine used vehicle you were thinking of buying right now, only it'll be almost FREE for you to own it.

If you go new, you can get 100k+ out of any car with proper maintenance.If you want to keep your out-of-pocket cost as low as possible and fit payments into your teacher's salary, you might check out something like a Kia Rio (I just leased one) or Kia Soul. I've seen great lease deals on these lately, e.g. $159/mo. with nothing out of pocket, 3 years, 12k miles a year. No worries except gas and regular maintenance and insurance. Five-year/60k bumper to bumper warranty, 100k/10 year powertrain warranty. My 2004 Elantra GT, purchased new when you could get a fully-loaded Elantra for $13k (not any more!), has almost 90k miles, is still under factory warranty, and has had little beyond regular maintenance--no problems at all for the first 8 years. So it's possible to not spend much for a new car and run it 100k miles or more with few problems. I like the Hyundai/Kia warranty for long-term ownership because engine/transmission problems are the most costly to fix, and I don't have to worry about paying for those for 100k miles or 10 years, whichever comes first.BTW, that Elantra has a KBB private party sale value of about $6k... after 9-1/2 years!

A CPO 3 yr old car is not a bad way to go either. Agree that a Honda or Toyota is probably not a good value at that age. In fact used car costs across the board are higher in the last few years. My '04 Pontiac Vibe is also listed at around 6k. So if you go that route consider a car that has good reliability history but not so well known, such as the Mazda3, Elantra, Nissan Altima or Sentra, or pretty much any Buick sedan. We bought the Vibe as a 3 year old car and it has been extremely reliable, needing only a battery and tires until this year --leaking struts . Buying used can be a good idea though. Insurance will be lower on an older car than a new one. If you check it out carefully you can hopefully get a couple of years without major problems. The key is to find a car that has been well-maintained by its previous owner and to ask about those items that might be problematic for a 5 or 6 year old car, such as battery, alternator, starter etc. It sounds like you are doing that kind of background work now.

Most new car warranties cover almost everything for 3 years and 36,000 miles. In addition, the engine and transmission are usually covered for 5 years and 60,000 miles. The Honda Fit, which is a very functional hatchback, is Honda's entry level car. Base price is about $17,000, but discounts are hard to get. You might get $700 off or so, but there's just not that much profit in the car, in part because it's made in Japan.The Civic is made in the USA in a huge state-of-the-art factory in Indiana. They are pumping them out full tilt and there are tons of them out there. I think it was the best selling car for Honda last month, and just behind the Camry. The Civic had significant improvements for 2013. In other words, don't get a 2012. Dealers are dealing on the Civic, and you should be able to get $2000 off list without much trouble. Even the base model has a few things not found on other cars in its class, like a back up camera.The Civic also was the only small car to get a good rating on the IIHS crash test. Check out this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8elevprV5ANot everyone agrees, but Honda fans like me feel that Hondas are often a little better at some things, like this crash test. In other words, for Honda fans there is a reason why they cost a little more. I think that extra is worth it and is buying you a slightly better car. Of course, fans of other brands feel the same about their cars, but watching that video above you can see that Honda did better than everyone else in that particular test. Same with midsize cars with the Accord. Probably some of the competition will catch up next year, but for now... ","Posts: 5,952",Member

I've been quoted a price of $18873.77 on a 2013 Civic LX and have been told it includes Oregon DMV fees. What are your thoughts on this price, and what fees might NOT have been added in there? For the record, I wont be needing any dealership added accessories.Also, one dealership I talked to said that they include a 100k powertrain warranty. I've been warned by other dealers that this is a trap of some sort. That if I miss any of their scheduled maintenance the deal is null and that, somehow as a result of the terms, I get roped into only doing business with their dealership (so if Jiffy Lube changes the oil, null).

Ask to see the warranty. It will spell out whether you must have all maintenance done by that dealer or not.Such warranties are not necessarily ""traps"", but ways some dealers use to differentiate themselves. A local car dealer chain in my area offers a free lifetime powertrain warranty on all new cars and all used cars with less than 60k miles. They are a reputable company so I doubt this is a ""trap"". But there may be conditions, e.g. keeping up with manufacturer's scheduled maintenance.Ask also to see the details on ""free tires"". Free loaners are pretty common. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I was in the same situation a while back, though. I had about 7-8K to spend, but the problem was this:Economy cars, even if they are made by BMW or Mercedes (as has happened in the past, even for them) age incredibly poorly once they hit about ten years old. Civics are reliable and all of that, but they are also falling apart and rattling at ten years old. The engine will still run forever, but it's just a beater at that point.The problem is that 7-8K buys you nothing good. It's all high mileage, sketchy histories, ex-rentals, taxis, won't pass smog, the AC is on its way out, of the transmission is slipping. You have to go to the 10-14K range, and that's where you hit the real problem:- Banks loan money at terrible rates for used cars vs new. - Used cars are often out of their warranty at even that much money.- You will spend $100 a month on upkeep- Banks won't touch anything over 7 years old, anyways. That means a 2006 at the most. And that's way out of $7K.- After you resell the car in 6-7 years, you'll get about half of your money back anyways, effectively dropping the purchase price to lease levels.- You need a reliable car early in your life the most. So $12K at 5% interest (typical for a used loan) plus repairs and upkeep ends up being about the same money as a new car $4-5K more.- No upkeep, no anything, and 0% financing if you buy domestic. So you can literally get a car for $250-$350 a month and that's all you end up paying.Case in point - my car. A 2014 Mustang. Base model, manual, nothing on it (comes standard with Civic EX level equipment anyways, or close to it). $340 a month. If I dumped your $7 into it, my payments would drop to $225 a month. Now, if I went with a much cheaper car, I could end up paying $250 a month to own a car. As has been pointed out, a new car will last 5-7 years no matter what brand it is these days. Minus the $7K, you would be looking at $150 a month. Add in the money you get back (about 40% of new price when you sell it), and it's just going to cost you $28 a month. Provided you get a cheap but decent vehicle.The math: $14K-9K (depreciation) = 5K you sell it for.$14K-7K (your cash) = 7K owed.Net difference, $2K over 6 years. Or about $28 a month.In my case, it was $100 a month loss, but that's also nothing. Better safety, more fun, and all of the other perks of a new car. Worth the money I'd be spending on upkeep of my old car? DUH.  ","Posts: 3,738",Member

Now, I feel that it's a poor person who gives advice without a solution or two being offered.I'll keep this short - Here is my short list of cars to consider new without breaking the bank:- Ford Fusion. Base model, nothing on it. $19-20K depending on the incentives you qualify for. Civic money for a car with more everything and about the same fuel economy.- Ford Mustang. Same deal - base model, nothing on it. $19K if you shop around a tiny bit. Mine gets about 24-25mpg combined in So Cal rush hour traffic/gridlock every day. Most economy cars don't do more than a few mpg better. Awesome fun to drive and comes very well equipped. - Honda Insight. At $17.5K, it warrants mention as it is a serious fuel-saver. Cargo space is OK as well. I like to think of it as a cheap econobox with a better engine than the Jeep Patriot. It's ticky-tacky and the interior screams budget, but it IS a Honda and it DOES get crazy mpg.- Chevy Cruze. You can get a left-over 2013 base model for about $15.5K. This is a tremendous value as it's almost Yaris cheap.- Ford Focus. The base model is $15K.- A base model Mazda 3 is also $15K. Though, the Focus is far better to actually drive.- A Honda Fit is $15K. Its claim to fame is cargo space. The manual in this is video game easy to drive, btw.- Mitsubishi Lancer. The 2013 ES are going for $14K. You can get new cars for $12K-$13K, but they tend to be very poor value. ","Posts: 3,738",Member

These are all good points, but following this logic there would be no used car market and everyone should buy a new car. I agree that $10-12k is the amount that gets a better used car nowadays, but plenty of people buy much older cars and do fine with them. There are many people who don't have the income to afford a new car and its a little elitist to insist that's the only way to go. I find it amusing how many people on these forums brag about their cars going 200k with only regular maintenance and then state that after 100k you can't trust any car. I think it would be helpful to the poster to suggest ways to maximize the chances of getting a reliable older car. Most cars nowadays have a good life well after 100k. I bought a car for my daughter with 90k on it and she drove it another 90k. Did it need repairs, some of them expensive? Sure, but in the main it was a very reliable vehicle with low insurance costs.

suydam makes a good point. Used can work out. And sometimes there's no other choice but used.In my personal experience, however, in the long run of ownership (c. 10 years) the ""savings"" of buying used is quite exaggerated. I'm sure there are exceptions to this, but I've found that a good new car with good resale value is not that far off in cost in the long run from getting an old used car with c. $1000 a year in maintenance and repairs. Both ways can work out, and often used is a bit cheaper, but the living experience with a newer car is almost always a lot better. Unlike with some things in life, cars really are in most ways better now than in the ""good old days."" A 2013 Civic, for instance, is significantly better than a 2003 Civic in pretty much every way, including safety, room, mpg, performance, NVH, features, etc.But if finances require used, perhaps a 3-4 year old Nissan Altima or something similar might be considered.

Once in a while, maybe used could cost more than new in the long run.Imagine this scenario. Someone buys a 10 year old car for 5k and keeps it for 5 years, putting an average of 1k of maintenance and repairs each year. At the end of 5 years it's a 15 year old car, and maybe worth a thousand or so, and they trade it in on another 10 year old car for 5kAnyway, at the end of ten years this person has spent something like 18,000 to buy the cars and for repairs (subtracting the c. 1k each for the trade-in when each of the cars was 15 years old). And at the end of ten years they might need to come up with another 5000 for another car....Say instead the person bought a brand-new car for 18k. Over ten years it might need about 3k in maintenance and repairs, for a total of 21k. But at the end of ten years the car has a resale or trade in value of at least 5k, and so the total drops to 16k. And at the end of ten years, with luck and a tune up, the car still has five years left in it and you don't have to come up with another 5000. This is, I think, what Kirstie was talking about in a good point she made earlier.Maybe my figures are off a bit, but in this imaginary case at least new is slightly less than used in the long run.

Another way to get firm pricing is to try one of our Price Promise dealerships in the area:http://www.edmunds.com/inventory/srp.html?action=inventory&make=Honda&sub=Civic%- 20Sedan&trim=LX&zip=98662&radius=100They are OBLIGATED to honor the quote they provide. I don't mean the regular ones that say ""get a quote,"" but the ones that have ""special offer"" where the price would be. I'm not saying the others wouldn't honor a quoted price, but the Price Promise dealerships have to, and we've seen several reviews from consumers that indicate that that was their experience. The thing about the extended warranty offered by the dealership is that it is specific to THAT dealership, meaning that if they go out of business, or you move, that portion of the warranty is useless to you as it is only honored at the specific business where you purchased.

The problem with that scenario is that used cars are holding their value at a much higher rate than previously. Try to get any car that runs for $1000! I just sold my 12 year old car for $4500 and had two pages of email requests. I could have gotten more but I just wanted to sell it quickly and get a fair price for it. My current 9 year-old Vibe is worth nearly $6000. I paid $10k for it 5 years ago, have replaced tires, a battery (just last year!) and this year, leaking struts. It's had 1 year of $1000 repair. Really old cars are even better. My teenagers could only afford extremely old cars. When they sold them, they pretty much got the same amount. So their only cost was maintenance.The real problem now is the fact that 3 year old cars, which used to be a bargain compared to new, no longer are. It's unfortunate that people with limited means no longer have this intermediate way of getting a vehicle. Exceptions to that are some GM models possibly like the LeSabre and Lucerne and also the Century. Some of them have very low mileage too. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Stay clear of that warranty, then. It seems as if you do even one oil change someplace other than the dealership, it voids the warranty. I've had to do such a thing out of necessity before, i.e. when on a long trip and it was time for the oil change, so I took the car to a dealer where I happened to be for the service. Have done that a few times over the years. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Hey everyone, thanks a ton for the information; I'm reading through it all carefully and doing a lot of research as a result.A few questions on the new vs used paradox: (1) does anyone know, off hand, the cost difference between liability insurance on a 10 year old sedan vs full coverage on a new sedan? I am running the numbers online and I find that the liability insurance would be roughly $80.00 and the full coverage would be $105.00; does this sound correct? A big part of working out the math on this requires that I understand the difference in cost of insurance.(2) Much of the assumption seems to rest on the fact that we are spending about $1k a year on repairs. I have seen that number quoted before on this site, is there an article breaks that cost down? I ask because I ran the number by some car guys (they perform all their own routine maintenance and drive cars that are 10 - 20 years old), and though their experience is only anecdotal, the three of them each thought that $1k was way inflated. (3) In keeping with (2), let's say that we limited our used car search to 8 year old cars that had the expected number of miles and were being sold by the original owner, an owner who always/only got the car dealer serviced and, seemingly, treated the car well; if the $1000 a year is the cost of maintenance on an average used car, how much less will the car described cost us per year in maintenance? Thanks everyone. ",Posts: 79,Member

I looked into it a bit more and it seems that, though I'm sure they build it into the selling price, the warranty is free. So I don't necessarily lose anything I've paid for in the event that I deviate from the terms of the warranty. ",Posts: 79,Member

All good issues to consider. The $1000 is only a rough guide. Some years you won't have any maintenance at all other than an oil change; one year you could get a big whack like leaking CV boots, alternator, all in one year. There's no way to tell. You greatly improve your chances if you buy a 1-owner, well-maintained car that has historically been very reliable (like the Civic you are most interested in). You improve your chances still more if you get it thoroughly checked out before you buy.Liability insurance only is waaaaay less than full coverage. But it depends on the state and area where you live. I would call a couple of insurance agents and ask them to give you an idea over the phone. If you can give them specifics they will often help out with a general quote --you need the model type, such as LX or DX, and if you are looking at a specific car the VIN. Where I live, liability only on my 12 year old car was around $100 for 6 months; on my new Accord full coverage is over $400. And I live in a rural area where insurance is much cheaper than in a city. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I'm a pretty frugal money conscious kind of guy so my initial impulse when I hear ""purchase new"" is ""OMG no, depreciation!!!!"" but I do see that a used car can end up costing the same, if not more. Essentially, my goal, is to have the most reliable vehicle possible, while incurring the least overall costThere's always secret option C, which I chose. A nearly-new, certified used car. In 2010, I bought a 2009 Sonata GLS V6 with moonroof/popular equip package - a $24k car, for $14,400 out the door. It had 48,000 miles on it, clearly had been used as a highway car (the interior was and still is perfect, and it came with a 10 year / 100k bumper to bumper warranty, like a new car). I've had two main dealer service visits outside of regular maintenance/oil changes. One was a belt pulley that had a bearing go bad and my Stability Control system got a software update to prevent random ""ESC OFF"" lights on my dash. That's it. The thing to weigh out when going this route is the cost of used vs. new. There was clearly a big gap in price at the time because while the vehicle I bought had adequate reliability ratings from places like Consumer Reports, it's resale value wasn't great. That made my car a veritable steal. However, Hondas and Toyotas hold their value very well; this is great if you buy new, but it makes buying used a less cost-effective proposal. My Hyundai has been reliable like a new car (because it nearly was) but didn't have the up-front cost. It now has 109k miles on it and still gives me 30mpg on my commute. Just another perspective.

For many years I've owned two old wagons. They certainly required a lotof maintenance, but I probably saved 40-to-50K with these wagons. Exceptfor jobs like roofing, I never called a contractor. Sometimes I thought aboutbuying a pickup truck, but I could carry lumber, pipes, etc., inside the wagons or on the roof racks. The best decision I ever made was not buying a truck.One of the wagons develped massive electrical problems. My incrediblygood local mechanic refused to say, ""junk it!"" After several months I donatedthe car to a charity. I want to sell or trade wagon number two.The only ""real"" wagon that I occasionally see is a large, rectangular shapedVolvo. Like all Volvo cars, it's very expensive.Sites like AutoTrader have a wagon category, but most modern wagons area hybrid cross between an SUV and a mid-sized sedan. The car I see all thetime is the Subaru Outback. It doesn't have the length of my old wagons,which means a roof rack would be the only option for small quantities of lumber.My spending limit is 25K. A slightly used 2011, 12, or even 13 is what I'm lookingat right now. I could easily buy a car with cash. A smart relative once told menot to do that. He said, ""car dealers don't care about you, once they've got allthe cash."" These days, warranties are much better than years ago. I supposepaying with cash is safe, if you have a lengthy warranty.Frankly, I'm having a minor nervous breakdown! I have to buy something, butI don't know enough about the blizzard of vehicles available these days. HugeSUV's are like trucks. I won't buy a truck or a monster SUV.

graduate has a great point here. Hyundai's have at least as good quality as Toyota, and have for at least 5+ years. And yet the reputation hasn't quite caught up, and so resale values aren't quite as strong, although they've been going steadily up.A 2010 Sonata, just before they introduced the all new 2011, is a very good car, but probably could be had at a big discount from your local Hyundai dealer. The longer standard warranty on the Hyundai is a plus.Hyundai's are very well engineering and built cars. Built in the USA in a state-of-the-art factory. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

While there might not be a used car market if everyone followed my advice (heh) , buying a seven to ten year old car is going to be a major problem at $7K. It's all about the break-points.With $7K, that means you're looking at $15K optimally, with some wiggle-room. Driving a $15K car, putting down $7K, and then selling it for $6K after it's run 100K miles means about $5K in extra taxes, insurance, and depreciation over a used car over the life of your loan.One major repair like a transmission on the used car can eat half of that up. A new radiator(plus belts, water pump, and so on)? $700-$800 by the time you are all done. Electrical issues? Water leaks? Rattles? A new Cat? Smog? it can be done, but it all grinds away at that differnece.Is better safety, better fuel economy, a warranty, and so on worth $80 extra a month? It's up to you. I think so. I like my MP3 player, 300HP, and non-econobox handling and style. Used might have made sense when cars only lasted ten years and you could get a 3-4 year old one for peanuts, but now anything good retains half of its value almost a decade old.

I still suggest new over used. Low miles won't always assure low repair costs. Time does things to a car too, and sometimes only short city trips (which is what low mile cars like this must be) can cause their own issues.Of the two, however, I'd probably suggest the Accord. The Civics of that era are rather flimsy. The Accord is a different class of vehicle and more solidly built.As much as I love my Hondas, I think it's possible you might be buying too much into the idea that ""a Honda will last almost forever."" Hondas age better than most cars, and generally last longer, but they still age and require $$ when they get old. Hondas back in those days often didn't have anti lock brakes, no side air bags, and Honda's acclaimed Advanced Compatibility Engineering hadn't even been thought of yet, and wouldn't be for about 10 years. Engine tech has also advanced a lot since the mid to late 1990s. If you're fixed on used, I think you'd be better off with a one-owner Hyundai Sonata from c. 2007 for about the same money. Paying that much money for cars that are that old doesn't make a lot of sense imho. You might luck out, but you might not and could be facing some major issues in the next 5 years.

I wouldn't pay nearly $7k for a 15 year old econobox no matter what badge is on it.Low miles is not necessarily a good thing. If the odometer is accurate, the car was driven only 200 miles per month. That indicates to me mostly short, infrequent trips--can be hard on an engine, worse than highway driving. Also with a Civic of this age, rust can be an issue--be sure to have the underbody checked.

I was thinking private party. But it was just a guess. And probably I had an overly optimistic idea of how low a price you might find on a 2007 Sonata. Sorry about that.Here's another thing to factor in: how much do you think you'll drive each year? If you drive the average amount (12-15k a year) a car with good mpg (say 30 or higher epa combined mpg) might save you as much as $500 compared to a car with ""average"" mpg (say 23 mpg). This is another argument for a newer car with a higher tech engine and transmission. Believe it or not, a new 2013 Accord gets about the same mpg as a 2003 Civic. Or, compared to a 2003 Accord a 2013 Accord you can save about $500 a year on gas. Just to make it more complicated to think about!Good luck...PS That 12,500 at the dealership is the asking price. You might be able to get a thousand or so off of that. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

A 1999 Civic is rated 27 combined mpg. Annual fuel cost is estimated by the epa to be $1950A 2013 Civic is rated 32 combined mpg. Annual fuel cost $1650. So a difference of $300 a year, which over a decade adds up to $3000.The 1999 Civic sedan is 175 inches long and 67 inches wide.A 2013 Civic is 179.5 inches long and 69 inches wide. May not sound like much, but what this translates to is that the 2013 Civic is a roomier car inside and has a bigger trunk compared to the 1999. It also gets to 60 faster, which is sometimes nice when merging onto a freeway even when you're driving an economy car. The 2013 is also a much, much safer car than a 1999 Civic.

I would make 2005 the cutoff date for buying used. You do realize that '96 is a 13 year old car. And if it really has that low miles, it means it has sat, A LOT. In the Portland climate, you are probably looking at a lot of interior wires and lines that will have to be replaced, among God knows what else.2005 will get you standard ABS brakes, dual airbags, and other safety features that you don't want to be without. That means probably not a Honda, but you could be looking at other cars that are reliable but depreciate more. Hyundai Elantra, Pontiac Vibe, Buick Century are examples.Buying a used car from a dealership is no different from buying new. You still have to negotiate a price. You can often get 1500 2000 off the asking price. And get it checked out from your own mechanic too first. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Yikes. Probably better than a 1999 Civic, but....That's a very small, not very safe, and not very impressive car at all. Have you ever seen one? Tiny. Believe it or not my 2013 Honda Accord gets better mpg than that car.You know, if you've got a job as a teacher (I'm one too), Honda or any other car maker is likely to be happy to finance you on a car with only c. 10% down at or near 0% financing rates over 5 years. The car should last ten years, and probably more.If you're in Portland, maybe consider picking up a copy of tomorrow's Oregonian. Maybe look at the screaming print ads for the car dealerships. The ones that say things like ""2013 Toyota Corolla $15,999,"" or maybe even ""2013 Mazda3, $14,999."" I'm making those numbers up, but similar numbers are in my local paper. Just my 2 cents.

In terms of price, is there any threshold you'd refuse to cross if you were doing business with a private seller? IE, you'd gladly buy for sub $10k but once you get past that you'd be better off going to a dealer? This is, of course, assuming we do due diligence.

http://www.iihs.org/research/hldi/compositeIf you look at the data, given actual insurance payouts, mass wins. A tiny car simply does worse overall versus other cars. They also tend to have little to no real safety equipment standard in the 10-15 year old range. A 2000 Buick LeSabre, by comparison had ABS and stability control and so on, just because they put more money into it. You'll see that larger cars win most of the time.So you're doubly behind the eight-ball here. $7K means old and small and a world less safe than new and midsize. Or old large, and a rust bucket.

I've done a lot of private party deals and I don't have a particular threshold for price. If anything, I usually find the higher dollar vehicle to be better bargains because the market is very narrow. Most folks buying pricey vehicles have trades to deal with or timing of private selling their own vehicle. As for the bank, usually the headache is if the seller has a loan on their car. Many banks won't send the new buyer the title directly. There's usually a little risk involved there but I've never been burned. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

That warranty isn't worth that much. They are covering items that rarely if ever cause trouble. They are pretty safe in offering this and it appeals to what we call ""warranty people"" whose main concern when buying a car is the length of the warranty.Actually a smart move on their part!And they do require that you service your car at their dealership which isn't unreasonable. I know I wouldn't take my lawnmower to one of those Quickie Lube shops. They aren't much less money and they use questionable tactics and tend to oversell items.You may spend a bit more at a dealer but they use the correct oil and they don't use cheaply made oil filters etc. Well worth the difference!After reading all of this, I think you are a prime candidate for leasing a new 2013 LX Civic! You will love the car! You can keep your 7000.00 intect somewhere and at the end of the lease, you can walk away or purchase the car fro the residual. You could, at that point, use 7000.00 as a down payment and have a very low payment and still have a nice, reliable and safe car! ","Posts: 20,350",Member

If you see a new car of the make you are considering in a parking lot, ask the owner about their experience.Instead of asking for the ""Internet Manager"" who is usually nothing more than a rotating inexperienced salesperson, ask the receptionist for a nice, experienced salesperson who has been there a long time.It really can be a relaxed, easy experience and no, you won't end up paying more.

That's true.If you were to invest two million (or more) dollars into a car dealership you would expect a decent return on your money I would hope.Otherwise, just keep those two million invested in conservative mutual funds and bonds and sit back and earn a ten percent return every year.But, some buyers don't think you are entitled to a profit. They think you should sell your cars for what you paid for them or even less. These same buyers demand top dollar for their ratty trade in that you hope some wholesaler will take at a break even profit to the store.I tried to maximize profits on every car I sold. That was my job and I was good at it. I didn't do this by lying or paying games. If I had to deeply discount a car and the deal made sense (important!) I would do what I had to do to make the deal happen.The people who were the cheapest grinders never left happy. They somehow left thinking that just maybe someone else somewhere could have bought that same car for less! These people were never loyal. They would give mediocre surveys and were difficult to deal with in the Service Department down the road.For me, it seemed like a small, miserable way to go through life but I suppose we are all different.Life is short...

Exactly right... it's the salesperson's job to maximize profit on every car.So there's a lot more to buying a car at a good price than finding a nice, friendly, helpful salesperson at the dealership. I know some very nice car salespeople, and it was a pleasure dealing with them. But I didn't take their first offer... or second. Maybe not their third, either. I understand they're trying to maximize profit. I'm trying to get the lowest price I can. And it's always the salesperson's prerogative to tell me when they've gone as low as they can, to ensure they make enough profit on the deal. I respect that kind of honesty, as I know where I stand. And if it's a good price, I'll take it. If not, we'll shake hands and I'll move on. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

All the new cars I've bought have been good experiences in terms of the salesperson. Probably a lot of that is luck. But I also try to make my own good fortune by doing a lot of research, knowing exactly what I want and knowing the numbers, and treating the salesperson with respect and good humor. If they like you and want to make you happy, often things go well and a good deal is achieved with smiles all around. I got $2700 off of my hard-to-find deep red 2013 Accord EXL navi just a few months after it was introduced. Buying and owning a good car is one of the many pleasures in life, imho. Not everyone is so fortunate. I used to not be so fortunate. Sounds silly, but I'm grateful now to own my good Accords, a 2008 and 2013. After decades of driving mostly sucky cars, they are are both excellent, and by far the best cars I've ever owned. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Hello all, I hope this is the right thread but I need some help deciding on what to do. My lease is up on my 2011 Acura tsx and its been a great car. Although my finances were better when I first got the car that's changed. Anyways to get to the point if I were to purchase my tsx after my lease is up my contract states it would probably be about 20k. So I started looking at cars at this price and even lower. I've got my eye on a new or 1 year old Kia optima. So which would be the better buy? Obviously the optima would come out cheaper and it's newer compared to my 3 year old tsx. But I'm sure the tsx has merits that surpass the optima. I want to look and compare everything on both cars because this next purchase I want to keep the car for a good 10-15 years. So it has to be long lasting. No expensive parts in case I need to repair. Insurance would be a key point too. Which would you go for? Thanks for all the help! ",Posts: 4,Member

You need to figure out the market value of your TSX and compare that to the buy-out. If the buy-out is a fair deal and you really like your TSX then I think that would be a fairly safe bet. Anytime you KNOW the history/care/etc of a used car it should be worth more to you. Now if for some reason the buy-out is higher than what you can buy a similar TSX...then it may not make sense. Some of the new Kia's/Hyundai's are nice...but to keep one 10-15 years? I think the TSX would be a far better long-term car and you would enjoy it more. Average out the additional cost over 15 years and even a $5,000 premium looks pretty cheap. My experience with Acura is that the service/repairs really aren't that expensive if you find a good dealer or even an independent mechanic that specializes in honda/acura. Certainly nothing like many of the other ""luxury"" brands. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Residuals are set according to what they think the wholesale or auction values will be at lease end. If they set residuals too high as they sometimes do, they can take a beating when the cars fall short at the auctions.TSX's are nice cars but not all that popular. If you can buy a nice one for 20K, you will be doing OK.You can't negotiate a residual! That would be opening a can of worms and no different that if they decided to RAISE it at the end.Lastly, why buy a 2010 when you know the car you already have....unless....you know you've been sloppy with maintenance as some lessors can be sometomes.

What about an Accord LX? It's only slightly more than a KIA, but gets better mpg, better safety ratings, has better visibility (KIA has the largest blind spots on the market, because of huge rear roof pillars), and has more standard equipment. Even in the last generation the Accord LX was missing some key things, such as bluetooth, alloy wheels, dual climate control, upgraded engine, etc. But now all of that is included in the LX. Check out this price from Crest Honda in Nashville. Similar prices on the LX are available in most of the country. My parents own one of these and they love it. This generation of Accord has a significantly upgraded and quieter interior. Some Honda fans, only half joking, call it the ""Acura Accord."" Coming from your TSX, I think you'd feel right at home.

You can't negotiate a residual! It IS possible to negotiate a residual. I have done it before, with NMAC, on a leased Sentra. When the lease was almost up, I called NMAC and made them an offer, lower than the residual on the contract, and they accepted it.Whether the residual on a specific leased car is negotiable is an open question.

I am looking within the next year to replace my wife's Saturn Aura XR as it will be 6 years old and out of warranty. It has been a good car but I don't see any V-6 powered midsize cars from GM anymore. I like the power of a v-6 but do not want a 4cyl Turbo . I had some in the past which all had engine problems after 50-60k miles and as a result I am not convinced of their long term durability, regardless of the manufacturer. My cousin has a Turbo 4 cyl RDX and am not at all impressed with the powertrain.I would not consider Toyota or Mazda so that would leave me with a choice between Honda and VW. I am skeptical of VW reliability. I would consider the Honda Accord V-6 which looks like a nice car and reasonably priced even loaded up, but there are a ton of negative reviews for the V-6 model, mostly oil consumption and VCM problems.

I think Honda's V-6's are reliable these days. And because of the VCM, they get about the same mpg as many 4 cylinders. I've read that you can feel it when the VCM cuts off some cylinders and so you should give it an extensive test drive to see if you can live with that. Consumer Reports recommends the Accord, including the V-6, and they will not recommend something that they don't think will be reliable.http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/04/top-picks-2013/index.htm""What it takesTop Picks must meet our criteria in three areas: Road test.

If I had $28k to spend on a car, it wouldn't be on an Accord.

And same size class, e.g. used Lexus ES vs. new Accord EXL V6? e.g. you could get a low-miles CPO 2010 (maybe even a 2011) ES for $28k or less. Much more comparable to the Accord EXL V6 than the LS.

Hey all. I've had a lot of trouble deciding on what I want for my first car, so I was hoping you guys could maybe help me out. I'm looking for mid to full-size used sedan in for around $5000-6000. I am an 18 year old guy so insurance is a factor and I can't go for anything too sporty. So far I've looked at some Pontiac Grand Prixs and I really like them, but my mom's very worried about the safety ratings on them (she's the one paying for most of the car). The frontal driver crash ratings seem ok, but the side impact crash ratings are pretty poor from what I've seen (link title). I'm kind of new to the car market so I'm not really sure how important these ratings are. Of the other cars that I've looked at I've also liked the Acura Integra, Nissan Maxima, Chevrolet Impala (although I've heard that these don't hold their value too well and while I like the exterior and the way they drive, I don't really like their interior), and Infiniti G35. I've also been inside an Audi A4 and I really like those as well, but they're probably a little too expensive for me to maintain at this stage in my life as I will be a college student next year. While I've liked all these cars I also haven't really found any that click like the Grand Prix. I also really really like the Pontiac G8 (outside my price range), so if there's a car similar to it that I have overlooked, I would probably like that as well.So down to the more specific criteria. As far as styling goes I like cars that have kind of sporty exteriors like the G8/Impala and sleek interiors like the Audi A4, G8 or Grand Prix. Fuel efficiency doesn't matter too much as I won't be driving the car very far all that often, but I don't want a real gas hog either. I also don't really want car older than a 2000.

Hey Craig - how are ya? You know that I hold you in high regard and my observation is that you are an honest straight shooter. If you were still in the business and nearby, I'd probably be doing my Honda buying/leasing from you. What I have found these past 5-10 years is that the better dealers have established and operate effective Internet Sales Departments. The ones that only go through the motions and try to put on a face are easily exposed by the way they interact with customers. You know from your experience that it is difficult to conduct negotiations over the phone and all too many dealers put on the hard sell while you are at their location because they know when you leave you may not return. I prefer to work my way to a target price via email now - there might be a couple phone calls along the way but I won't go to a dealer until the numbers are nailed down and I have written confirmation in hand. And as I say, after you've done this for awhile, it is fairly easy to pick out the good Internet depts from the not so good (the way you were probably able to distinguish the buyers). I realize that the way you've described the store you worked at, it sounds customer friendly. But for the most part, dealers still put buyers through the wringer (especially the inexperienced ones) if they show up unprepared. Thanks for listening,Bill ",Posts: 699,Member

At that price point your first criterion is a trouble-free car that runs well. Of the vehicles you mentioned, I would suggest an early 2000s Maxima. Those are great cars but they do require premium fuel. But you might take a look at a Toyota Camry or a Buick LeSabre. They are not the most exciting to drive, but they will run forever and parts are plentiful. Any car at that price will have around 100k on it, so have it checked out very carefully before you buy.A smaller hatch you might look at is the Pontiac Vibe. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Besides the Impala, everything you listed will likely be expensive to insure. The grand-prix might not be terrible but sometimes just ""looking"" sporty will cost you big money. I have no clue what state you're in or what other factors you have for insurance, but since you mention that cost is a factor, I think you should discuss this with your (moms) insurance agent. Buying a $5k Acura/Infiniti/Audi is likely a very bad idea anyway due to potential repair costs and it doesn't sound like you're ready to self-mechanic. Those can be ok investments if you're handy with tools and have access to salvage parts, but otherwise you'll spend a fortune paying someone else to do it.I actually like the Impala idea if you like it. They're relatively reliable and cheap to buy/operate. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

If you find yourself interested in the Vibe or Toyota Matrix (same car basically) then avoid a manual transmission. Your price point would buy you one ready to blow up as they were a poor design. I have been unable to confirm if Toyota Corolla uses the same manual transmission as the Vibe, but suspect they are also to be avoided.The autos in all 3 were fine. But these are a bit on the small side given your size requirements. In order to help keep insurance costs in check, avoid 2 door coupe types, and basically any model that many young drivers are drawn to. Statistically, there are more insurance claims with those types and the premiums reflect that. It was good advice to check with your insurance agent prior to a purchase. Any offer to purchase should always have a clause along the lines of ""subject to my financial ability to insure"". ","Posts: 2,345",Member

I rarely feel comfortable telling someone else what choice *they* should make. After all, I'm not sure what your financial situation is, and I'm not sure what would make you happier, and I'm also not sure how long you intend to keep the vehicle.However, if I were looking at those two options, it'd be the LS430 all day long. This is simply because I'd be perfectly happy with a used vehicle at a lower purchase price, and from everything I've seen (and those I know who own that vehicle), they tend to last forEVER. The Accord probably will too, but at a higher entry price. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

For the love of Pete! Lol! You'd consider that little econo dog whose life is probably half over, when for less than twice that you could get a brand new Mazda3, Corolla, or Civic, financed at almost 0% that would likely give you a decade of trouble free driving....In any case, you said you wanted a car that looked nice for your wife to be in. That one ain't it imho.The Versa is a small and rather unsafe car, which gets 27 mpg combined, compared to the larger and much safer Civic that gets 32 mpg. So you save about 300 a year on gas with a Civic, which over a decade means a savings of 3000. Plus, it's highly unlikely you'll be driving the Versa in the year 2023. Before that you'll almost certainly need to buy a another car costing more $$. A new car is likely to be doing ok in 2023, and have some ok resale value. I feel like this stuff is water going over a duck's back. But as you said, the paradox is that used can cost more than new in the long run of a decade. Are you sharing any of this with your wife?

Not only does he insist this, he, with ""lol's"" and ""great pete"" exclamations, tries to drive home the absurdity of doing anything but that. Since I don't want to completely assume that Benjamin simply doesn't know how to give good advice, or doesn't know how to tailor his advice to a specific person's needs, I am trying to check in with Ben to see what other pieces of information (like what he thinks a reasonable amount to budget on transportation is) might give me reason to believe his advice makes sense for me.

If I recall correctly, I think Benjamin's point is that if you bite the bullet now and purchase a dependable new vehicle, you will still have something that has some value at the end of your intended use - and encounter a lot less hassle along the way. The drawback is you will have a car payment. The folks on the other side of this say to heck with that - buy a good used vehicle and save your bucks. Problem is most used vehicles in your price range will be purchased ""as is"" and it will be a gamble as to how much it will cost you in the long run. You are the one who needs to decide - spend your 7 grand and have no payments or buy new and have a car payment. Now this is just my opinion - if I was able to swing the payments and go new - I would do that. If not, I'd plunk down the 7 grand and hope for the best.Benjamin has offered you solid advice and shouldn't have to qualify it.

I have my point of view, but honestly I was joking. Used can work fine, and for your budget might be a better choice. A Versa of that vintage for that price didn't seem like the best choice to me.

It doesn't say what trim -- if it's the basic DX that's more like $3000 and would be a very good buy if it checks out mechanically. $6000 seems high for a 12 year old economy car. Did you look at private party value on the Edmunds used car site? It adjusts for your area (I don't know Portland zip code so I plugged in mine in the midwest, which is where I got $3000).

It appears that it is the LX (picture from the back has the LX emblem), which, if in outstanding condition has a private party value of $4,500 on Edmunds and $4,000 on KBB.If you're going the private party route, how closely would you expect your purchase price to reflect KBB or Edmunds suggested value? It seems that cars are routinely priced 40% higher than suggested by those sites.

 Too many variables to answer this question really. Mainly because we have no idea the service maintenance history of any of those examples. The only way you could make an educated comparo based on that, would be to drive each. If you are fairly perceptive with your driving, the drive would reveal which one had the best maintenance history. If, on paper, they all proved the same service history, then I suspect the Civic (assuming it didn't need any steering gear replacements, like a ball joint) would probably feel better than the lesser miled Kia of that generation. Was it in 02 Civic went to McPherson strut from the double wishbone front? As another example, I would say the strut quality used in the Honda would be better than those used in the others mentioned. The Honda engines were definitely superior in this class if all serviced equally. ","Posts: 2,345",Member

Couple of things...1) a 2002 LX is really poor in safety... no ABS... no side airbags, for example. 2) the car has a timing belt I believe... which would be due for replacement at 120k miles. A pricey service.I think for $6k or a little more you could get a much newer car (not a Civic of course) with full set of airbags and ABS (and maybe ESC). For example, I recently bought a 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatch in great condition for only $4900, from an Infiniti dealer. It has 160k miles on it, but highway miles and was well maintained by its one lady owner. Has 6 airbags, ABS, and traction control. And a heckuva much nicer car than a 2002 Civic... roomy, power seat, leather wheel, 17"" five-spoke alloys, hatchback convenience etc. Had to replace the alternator already, but that cost $160 part/labor. And it has a timing chain, not a belt. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

The 2002 Civic never had side curtain airbags. Those didn't come to the Civic until the 2006 redesign. The 2002 Civic did offer as an OPTION front-seat-mounted side airbags. They would help only the driver and front passenger; not the same thing as side curtain airbags which protect all passengers except the rear middle.For both ABS (optional) and standard side airbags on a 2002 car that could be had at a good price, and IMO a better car than the 2002 Civic, try the Elantra.

Thanks for clarifying. The info of options is a little confusing. Yes, I did see it as an option. Those only were standard on more upmarket cars like my '01 Maxima. But it does mean that this Civic might have them and might be something to find out or use in negotiating a lower price if they don't, as well as lacking ABS. You're generally not going to find standard ABS and the better side curtain airbags as standard equipment on mainstream cars before 2006. That the Elantra may had them that early surprises me, but I still think the Civic overall will be a longer-lasting car from that era than the Elantra. According to Edmunds the '02 Elantra's air bags were also the front mounted type. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Edmunds is wrong. Starting in fall of 2000, the 2001 Elantra was the first car in its class to have side airbags standard. I should know, I owned one. :-)My sister still owns that 2001 Elantra and it's held up quite well. I still own a 2004 Elantra, from the same generation, and after nearly 10 years in the Rust Belt it's held up great, would still look new if not for parking lot dings/scratches, and has been very reliable. When I bought that 2001 Elantra I also looked at the then all-new 2001 Civic. Not only did it cost thousands more than the Elantra, but the Elantra offered much more power, smoother and more quiet ride, more comfortable driving position (8-way adjustable seat), more interior room (EPA mid-sized class by volume), longer warranty, and the standard side airbags. Now as a used car, if you can find a well-maintained Elantra of that 2001-2006 generation, it would make a very nice vehicle IMO. The main downside is that ABS/TCS is optional and hard to find. Standard ABS starting in 2007. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Once again I would use safety and other features as bargaining points to lower the price. On that car side curtain airbags were optional, so it probably doesn't have them. Probably no ABS either. Does it have a CD player? Remote entry? I would start several hundred dollars lower and bargain down depending on what it lacks. Once you get a price, get it checked out.

So my research shows that the price he is asking is fair in comparison to the price other dealers are selling for. What I don't know is, and I know there is no ""across the board"" method for determining how much markup is built into that price, how much I should be buying this car for. It appears that the trade in value the dealer would have paid (according to KBB NADA EDMUNDS) would have been roughly in the $3,500 range. I don't know how auction prices compare to those, but if it is the case that they have marked the vehicle up that much, then I want to make sure I let them profit off of me as little as possible (not to be construed as ""I'd like to steal it"", but simply that I don't want to be foolish). I don't know much about the used car market, but I think I know people fairly well, and I doubt that a 02 Corolla w 100k miles for $6,995 is going to be hard to sell. That being the case, I don't imagine that I have much of an advantage since, it would seem, the dealer can probably just wait for someone to come and buy it at a price pretty close to what they are asking. I could be wrong about that though.So, suggestions as to what price I should be aiming at? Perhaps I should just be waiting for a private party seller? I did see one yesterday for $4,500 and it was the same year w same miles. ",Posts: 79,Member

The #1 question you need to ask yourself is: do I really want this car? $7000 seems to be a very high price for a basic 2002 Corolla with 100k miles and 4 owners.I just did a search within 100 miles of the Twin Cities using one of the popular car search sites, looking for 2001+ cars ala Mazda3/6, Civic, Elantra, Corolla, Yaris, Sentra, Rabbit/Golf. I found several that are newer and/or with lower miles for a lower asking price, e.g.:2003 Corolla LE, 83k miles, $69002003 Elantra GLS, 51k miles, $6880 - has ABS and moonroof2002 Civic LX, 90k miles, $6800 - has the optional side airbags2005 Mazda6i Sport, 86k miles, $6400 - 6 airbags, ABS/TCSSo you probably have options besides that 2002 Corolla, if you broaden your search a bit. If anything, you could use other cars as bargaining chips to work the price of the Corolla down. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

How invested are you in this particular car? Can you negotiate for a lower price, knowing you might be unsuccessful and that car might be bought by someone willing to pay nearly 7 grand. Is that you? The trick to used car shopping is not to really care whether you get that exact car and to figure that another may come along at a better price point. There are a lot of used cars out there. Only you can decide how you want to approach this or any other car transaction.Myself, I take more of a ""meant to be"" attitude. If I could negotiate a price I thought I could live with, the car checked out mechanically, and the dealer accepted that price, then it's meant to be. If not, move on. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

The only real feelings I have about this car is that it embodies some of what I am looking for in a used car: good cosmetic condition, below average mileage, and it's of a make and model that's known to go another 150k miles. The #1 priority for me though is that I am making a purchase that is financially intelligent. To me this means that the car was purchased at a price much below what an uninformed buyer would have bought it at and that I found value in a way that another buyer wouldn't. At this point I still feel like I am at a HUGE information disadvantage and am so uncomfortable w spending $7,000 on ANY car that I really have no particular warm and fuzzy feelings about this one.My uncertainty is largely based on an unfamiliarity with how a dealer would price this vehicle. If it was standard for them to price a vehicle at 25% above what they are willing to let it go for, then I can reasonably offer them a price that I'm comfortable gets me the value I am looking for. If it is the case that they are only pricing the vehicle at 10% above what they are willing to let it go for, then there would really be no value in the car for me at all. Backy, were these prices dealer prices or private party? ",Posts: 79,Member

Not emotionally invested at all and would be perfectly happy if it was purchased from under me. What I'm struggling with is how to know what a fair price is for the consumer. The only real information I have to go off of are the popular online retail price suggestions, but if dealers simply never sell them at or around that price, it would be foolish of me to burn energy trying to figure out how to get them to do so.

Okay, so let's say it keeps getting repeated by knowledgeable folks like the forum members at Edmunds.com that this car is worth $5,000. In that case it would be reasonable to think that the guy who owns the dealership also knows in his/her heart of hearts that $5,000 is what this car is worth.My question is, what is a more reasonable assumption about how dealers purchase their vehicles: (1) They know the car is worth $5,000, they buy it at $3,500 and mark it up to $7,000 hoping for a sweetheart of a buyer but with the possibility of selling it at $5,000 to a smart buyer. (2) They know the car is worth $5,000 but, since they aren't looking to sell cars to knowledgeable buyers (and since wholesalers know how the game works), they buy it at $4,500 and mark it up to $7,000 looking for a sweetheart buyer with no intention of letting it go to a knowledgeable buyer for $5,000.

There is no point in trying to get inside a dealers head. They all have different motives depending on how their month is going. Just pick the price you want to pay and offer it. All they can say is no. End of story. Believe me, they aren't wasting that much effort over a 12 year old economy car. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Instead of trying to micro analyze this deal...what a dealer paid etc, I would suggest that you focus on what you think the car is worth TO YOU!Used cars sell for what the market dictates and popular models simply do not last long.

Backy...yes, in rare cases lease residuals can be negotiable but this doesnt' happen often. In the case of your Sentra, Nissan probably made a stupid decision in order to spur sales. In order to make lease payments attractive, they set too high of a residual hoping for the best.Knowing they were going to take a massive hit at auction, they allowed you to negotiate your buyout. This sometimes happened and it was a BAD thing because people came to expect this. They should have bit the bullet.Now, suppose they had screwed up and set the residual too LOW? Would you have allowed to let them negotiate that amount with you?Nissan isn't the only car company that made bad short term decisions for immediate gain only to pay a massive price at lease end.

These were all dealers.Sometimes a price is a price. When I bought the 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatch a couple of months ago, the asking price was $4,880. I knew that was a good price for that car. But I tried to negotiate with the sales rep anyway. He just smiled and told me, ""That's the price."" He pointed to the new Infinitis on the showfloor and said, ""If you would like to buy of these cars, I'll be glad to give you a big discount. But not on a $5,000 car."" So I paid the $4,880.

it's been in one accident, but not much front end damage according to the seller, who is a friend that I work with at my job...selling insurance. He has a wholesale dealer's license and will sell it to me through his buddy that has a retail license. He indicated that the damage amounted to the radiator being perforated near the bottom of it...and that all parts are original other than the radiator, which was replaced, and the airbag sensors in the front that he replaced. It has 137,000 miles on it. Original transmission. Some marks on the paint in various places...what you'd expect with a car that old. Tires will need replacing in 6-7 months most likely. Radio/Stereo was replaced with an aftermarket unit that doesn't take up all the room the old one did, so there is a gap/space of about a half inch on the bottom. Power seats. He indicates that he can get $4000 to $4,500 at either the auction or on the open market / auto trader / craigslist, but that he'll sell it to me for $3,000, which is about the value of a private sale according to Edmunds and KBB, so I'm not sure its a 'great bargain', but my deal is I just don't want a lemon.

The Crown Vick is an ancient architecture, but as tough as titanium. You can drive those things over curbs and not hurt them. The accident wouldn't worry me. It all comes down to care at those miles. Properly serviced, I've seen them run 300,000 miles without breaking a sweat in fleets. So, service records matter. The engine needs regular 5,000 mile oil changes. The Trans should have had 2 complete services by now. The rear axle, a grease change at 90,000. If it has had that kind of treatment, you have what you want. But $3,000 is plenty of money for it.

I was thinking about few cars like 2001 acura cl type s 2001+ toyota celica gt 2003+ corolla s Chevrolet Cobalt Subaru (legacy,impreza) , hatchback looks nice, but is 5k enough? Would love any BMW or audi A4 but i heard they are not good cars I also considered any acura/honda newer than 2000+ , civics (i like hatchback ones). I also thought about buying car for cheaper from insurance auction and fixing it. I have a friend who is a mechanic and has dealer's license and also could work with him on the car. I would love to get a 2dr but the insurance just scares me (celica). What car looks good, has decent insurance and is pretty fun to drive? Manual/Automatic - doesnt matter.

At your age unfortunately the insurance costs are going to trump every other factor. An older Civic or Corolla is probably your best bet, but you might also consider a bigger, older car like a Buick Lucerne (totally not fun but a pretty solid vehicle and cheap to repair) or a hatch like the 2005 or 2006 Pontiac Vibe. Sometimes insurance costs are less on larger cars. ABS wasn't standard until 2006, so insurance costs are higher on cars without them. The Vibe will be cheaper to insure if it has ABS. Some '04s had them as an option. Also if you stay in Chicago any of those will be good drivers in winter, a factor you didn't mention but certainly one to keep in mind (vs., say, the Celica).

In my commute daily which is 78 miles of Interstate (65-75mph) and 27 miles of 4-lane (with traffic lights peppering the drive), I'm averaging 24.2 on my second tank in a row according to the computer. I've not yet refilled the tank from full due to the fact that the computer wasn't reset when it was filled up upon purchase of the truck. However, if it's anywhere north of 23mpg, I'll be happy. I'm not feather-footing it, but when cruising around 70mph, the ""instant"" mpg meter is averaging 27 or so on flat ground. Of course if there's much of an incline and the cruise control drops a couple of mph, it'll downshift to 7th and hop right back to the set speed. At 60mph, it runs around 1,400 RPM (I have the 3.21 Axle, CrewCrab, 2WD). Maybe I'll shoot some video with my phone and throw it on youtube for the interested parties.TheGrad ","Posts: 9,731",Member

Alright all: I ended up purchasing a 2002 Acura TL with 106k miles for $6,000. It had the timing belt and water pump replaced at 90k and I had him replace the struts and shocks as well as the front motor mount before I agreed to the purchase (per mechanical inspection). In addition to the ABS and Side air it has a lot of amenities that I've never had in a vehicle before and is in near mint condition. It wasn't what I started out looking for but I found that if I wanted side air bags and ABS I'd have to pay at least 30% more than I really wanted to. ",Posts: 79,Member

I'm currently in the process of sorting through all that right now but, I may end up NOT being the new owner of an old Acura.I left the gentleman yesterday with a handshake agreement that if he got the struts and shocks & motor mount replaced, I'd pick it up Friday morning. At the beginning of the process he told me that the car had been into the dealership on a recall inspection and that they told him the transmission was not problematic. When I came home yesterday I started looking more into the transmission issues and realized just how severe they were so I made a few calls to the dealerships around here, checking the Vehicles vin history and I haven't gotten anything near a satisfying answer with regards to the transmission issue. I've told the gentleman he'll need to supply papers that confirm that his claim that the transmission is a non-issue is true. He sort of claims that he lost the papers and gave me a small run around when I told him that he should just contact the dealership.Anyways, I am sort of feeling bad because I did, without FULLY researching (but on his word) agree that if he had the strut/shock/mount work performed, I'd purchase the vehicle. He says it's in the shop right now and that he was going to pay the mechanic with the money I would end up paying him for the vehicle, and it seems as though I may be backing out of the transaction. Should I feel bad about this? Clearly I'm not obligated to buy the car, but I didn't necessarily make my purchase contingent on him showing me that paperwork -- but now suddenly I am. I feel like, as an act of good faith, I may be (sort of) obligated to compensate him in some small way for the work he is having done for me.Thoughts on this? ",Posts: 79,Member

It seems that the 2001 Acura TL had a really high rate of failure in the transmission and that a recall was issued. I've been told by a lot of people that if you are driving on the original transmission, you are a ticking time bomb.He told me that the dealer said his car doesn't need a new transmission, but I couldn't confirm that in conversation with the dealers. In addition the recall was issued 5 year before he became the owner so I have a hard time believing that he received any mail from the dealer asking him to come in to inspect the issue (he claims this is the case). Part of the problem is that we have a bit of a language barrier to cross. He admitted he can't read English very well. I believe he could have very easily gotten a letter from the dealership that said ""hey, it's time for your transmission servicing"" and he would have just understood that to mean they were inspecting the transmission to see if it was impacted by the recall when, in fact, all they were doing was draining the transmission fluid etc. The exact recall verbiage is as follows:Recall Date:APR 15, 2004Model Affected:2002 Acura TLSummary:ON SOME MINI VANS, SPORT UTILITY AND PASSENGER VEHICLES, CERTAIN OPERATING CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN HEAT BUILD-UP BETWEEN THE COUNTERSHAFT AND SECONDARY SHAFT SECOND GEARS IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO GEAR TOOTH CHIPPING OR GEAR BREAKAGE.Consequences:GEAR FAILURE COULD RESULT IN TRANSMISSION LOCKUP, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A CRASH.Remedy:ON VEHICLES WITH 15,000 MILES OR LESS, THE DEALER WILL UPDATE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A SIMPLE REVISION TO THE OIL COOLER RETURN LINE TO INCREASE LUBRICATION TO THE SECOND GEAR.

This means that they assessed the problem and then decided that a transmission replacement wasn't necessary. This is good news.

Hey all, I am coming off a lease on a 2010 Nissan Altima 2.5S Sedan. I just hit 31K miles on it and it's in pretty good condition. I am considering purchasing it since the set purchase price is decent (around 12.5K, KBB value is around 13.3K), the mileage is low, and I know where it's been the whole time . What are your thoughts? How does the Altima hold up over time? What are the maintenance costs like as the car ages? I'd plan on keeping it for the next 4-5 years. I have a longer commute nowadays so I am probably looking at 12-15K miles a year of usage. To be truthful, the car has been great but I am not particularly attached to it and would rather get into something like a small SUV (Rogue, Forrester, CR-V, Escape). But of course, I don't want to lose out on what seems like a good value on this car. Thoughts, opinions, reality-checks are much appreciated. Best,JG ",Posts: 13,Member

Unless you really need an SUV, keep the Altima. I've driven the Rogue. It's based on the old Sentra. I think you'll find it a come-down from the Altima. The others are nicer, but will cost a lot more than $12.5k if you buy new. One thing you might do is check with Nissan re special deals as you come off lease. I had a Sentra that came off lease this past summer, and Nissan was offering me 4 months waived payments, money towards wear & tear, and cash incentives to buy or lease a new Nissan. Leases are really good on the new Altima, or you could see what they would do on a Rogue or even a Murano if you want to go the SUV route. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Its definitely a fair purchase price. Seems they hit the nail on the head with the residual. That would probably get you right around $10k as a trade-in, $11k dealer auction, and $13k-14k retail. If you like it, I'd say keep it. At 31k miles, its just broken in. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I'm going to echo the other 2 members who've said to buy it.Even if you're not totally in love with it, it hasn't made you despise it. If you've got your eye on an SUV, your best bet would be to buy this (since it's at a lower price than you could likely find the same vehicle for on a dealer's lot), pay it off as quickly as you can, and then trade it in on an SUV. It'll make a nice downpayment. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

Thanks all. I appreciate the perspective. Backy - I wasn't a fan of the Rogue when I test drove it and chose the Altima over it so I think you're right that it would feel like a step down. Qbrozen and Kirstie, it does seem like buying it is the way to go. My other option would be to try to find a used CRV or Forester but it seems that those cars are a few K above the price my Altima, have higher mileage, and have the uncertainty of unknown previous owners. Does anyone know what the avg. yearly depreciation on a vehicle like the Altima is past year 3? 10%?15%?Thanks ",Posts: 13,Member

Q might be able to answer more directly, but you can check our True Cost to Own tool. It lists all of the costs, but breaks them out so you can see depreciation. Since your vehicle isn't at the 5-year mark, years 4 & 5 are estimated. If you want to look at more historical data, you can choose an earlier model year, though the depreciation is going to change based on other factors present for that particular model year (desirability, body style, etc.)http://www.edmunds.com/tco.html ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

I just sent my always reliable 1997 CV to the junkyard, a victim of underbody rust. Got 280,000 miles out of the 'ol girl.I use it for getting to sales calls only....no entertaining or clients or prospects ever are in the car. I now have a choice to make1.) A 1999 CV with 106k miles on it. A friend of a friend inherited it from her recently deceased Dad, who bought it new and most likely was garaged all the time. Lived in Florida until 2010 until he moved in with her family here in Indiana. No body damage, base pkg, white with grey cloth interior. No idea if the plastic intake manifold top was replaced during the recall, but I'd guess it was since seniors usually jump on that stuff right away. No idea on the transmission. Probably get it for around $2,200.-or-.2.) A 2004 Crown Vic with all leather interior and 139,000 miles on it. Some nicks and scratches, mainly cosmetic. Had a mild collision that popped the air bag sensor but not the airbag itself. Airbag sensor has been replaced. Rear rotors are warped, as the car surges straight when braking. Mild smoker smell, but not bad and doesn't cause any residual odor in one's clothes. Has a non-oem stereo replacement that doesn't quite fill in the space left my the original. I can get it for $3,000 from a friend who has a wholesale license and bought it at the auction here in Indy. He says he can get $4,500 for it at retail, but I'm helping him out work wise with some extra training, so he'll let me have it for $3k. I trust him btw. ",Posts: 11,Member

I'd take the '99. Known history, lower miles, and no significant changes from '99 to '04 that would be a ""gotta have"" in my book. I sold one recently that belonged to a deceased relative and it was in pretty poor condition with 140k miles. Got $2k for it the day it was listed so I think that one sounds like a great deal.

Where do you get info as to transmission problems? When I look at reliability data on various sites I only see ""infrequent"" or ""minimal"" transmission problems. It's generally a reliable car. Before you buy have a mechanic check it out.Are you planning to own the car for only 15 months? In that case I'd get an old car for the smallest amount of money. Our '01 Maxima had over 130,000 miles when we sold it in good condition. I am sure it will go another 100k. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

I agree. If you only plan to own a vehicle for 15 months, your best bet is to choose one that has already hit a low point in depreciation. For example, my son bought an older Honda Accord last year for $3700. 13 months later, it's still worth about $3700, maybe a couple hundred less. As a bonus, it's pretty good on gas and his insurance costs are low. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

We drive very few miles a year (probably about 6-7,000 total). Our primary vehicle is a 2011 Jetta Sportwagon TDI, which we own outright. It has 10k miles on it after 2 years. Our other car is a 2006 Saab 9-3. We purchased this about 1.5 years ago for about $9.5k. We've put 1.5k miles on it during that time.Unfortunately, the Saab has been a huge headache. We've probably put $2k into it in repairs, and it's been in the shop on multiple occasions. This is extremely inconvenient, both because I have a busy work schedule and hate taking time out for this kind of thing, and because although we don't drive much, there are specific times during the week where we need two cars.The Saab is in the shop again for a $700 repair, and I'm fed up. I'm considering selling the Saab (only worth $6.5k now to private party) and leasing a Nissan Leaf. This could be an ideal second car for us, since the vast majority of our trips are <75 miles, and for those few times where we take a longer car trip, we can use the Jetta TDI. I've always read that leasing is the worst financial decision (when compared to buying new and buying used), but I came across this article (http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=31045) about leasing a Leaf that makes it sound like a pretty good deal because of the Federal tax credit. And to be honest, I'm so tired of dealing with maintenance with the Saab that I don't think I can bring myself to buy another used car. The Jetta has been so nice in that respect; we've taken it in for the annual service and that's it.I realize that even if we spent $1k on repairing the Saab each year, it would probably be cheaper financially to do that than to lease a new Leaf. But as I wrote above, money is only one consideration. I suppose another option would be to sell the Saab to a private party, and apply that to the outright purchase of the Leaf. With the Federal tax credit, and the money from the Saab, we'd only have to shell out $15k which is not bad.I'd love to hear your opinions and advice! Thanks. ",Posts: 4,Member

Well of all the vehicles you could buy and put such few miles on....the Saab is most likely to cost you the most per mile. To get the most benefit out of a lease, you really need to utilize it for the stated miles. Basically you're paying for those miles whether you use them or not. Personally I think this is a great opportunity for a newer high mileage car. You can pick up a couple year old Camry/Accord with 60k-80k miles for $10k-$12k which means you're out of pocket $6k max. Most anything besides a Saab (or anything European for that matter) will need next to nothing for many years with such little use. I'd look for a private party car with great maintenance history and mainly used for highway driving. These cars usually go 100k-150k miles with almost no repairs.Buying a new car and putting very few miles on it will hurt the most because it's going to depreciate a huge chunk of money whether you drive it or not. A used car with high miles has already lost 50% or better and if anything after a few more years it will have average miles. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

There are a number of different possibilities for you to consider. I have also thought about leasing a Leaf as an around town car. Advice now is to lease because it is hard to say what the value will be in 3 years. Nissan recently cut the price rather dramatically.The other choice would be to sell private party and get a new subcompact the size of the Leaf, like a Honda Fit. You could still have a new car and something like the Fit holds its value well. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Yes, my experience has shown that owning a used Saab can be an expensive proposition. Before we got rid of ours, it was costing about $800/month in repairs... always something different. So, I can certainly understand the feeling of being worn out & burned by a ""needy"" used vehicle. However, as mentioned, pretty much any used vehicle is going to be better.And yes, leasing the Leaf would entail giving away miles. ","Posts: 11,133",Administrator

This would certainly be a sensible choice, as would buying a used car like a Camry. I'll need to look into options further, but to be perfectly honest at this point I may be willing to pay a little more for something nicer to drive. I test drove a Fit twice and it just felt like a tin can, especially compared to our current vehicles (Jetta Sportwagon TDI and Saab 9-3). ",Posts: 4,Member

I would have a hard time believing there's a big difference in ""tin can"" feel between a Fit and a Leaf. I don't like small cars at all so they all feel like that to me. You could pick up a lot of very nice used vehicles for the price of a new Fit and get far more for the money. Again, outside of Euro cars you should be able to own the thing for many years without spending much in repairs. ","Posts: 3,241",Member

Hi,So I wanted to ask everyone their opinions or thoughts on the reliability of Audi's and the maintenance costs of them. I am looking to buy a used Audi, undecided on model, produced from 2000-2005. I have heard a lot of negative things about Audi's reliability and their extremely high maintenance costs. I really just do love the look of Audi's and so I am still exploring purchasing one. However, I was wondering if members of the forum had opinions if certain models from 2000-2005 were considered more reliable and had lower maintenance costs. Any and all opinions would be much appreciated.Cheers,Chris ",Posts: 4,Member

Well, I am just one data point, but I had a 2002 Audi TT and after 4 years, just when warranty was up, I started having electrical issues. Basically, dashboard dials would wave wildly and then just shut down completely. Was more prevalent in cold weather. My mechanic told me to wait until the weather warmed up and then trade it. He said Audis are known for electrical problems, and once they show up, it is very hard to find the origin and fix them. That April, I traded it for a 2006 Lexus IS250 and never looked back. That car was perfect for 7 years, and this July I bought a new 2014 Lexus IS250. Consumer Reports only seems to cover from 2004 on, so no data there, though I will say, lots of black circles or missing data in their charts for Audis. ",Posts: 7,Member

Hello, I am looking for advice for my personal situation. Any advice would be much appreciated!
I am currently driving a 2006 Pontiac G6 GT Coupe with about 117,000 miles on it. I found out about a month ago that my fiance is pregnant with our first child. I like my car and it has no mechanical issues, but it is old and I'm not sure if I can get a car seat in it. My fiance has an SUV so I wouldn't have to drive the kid much, but I want to have the ability to do so.
So my question boils down to this, should I keep the car or sell it when the baby comes? The next obvious question is if I sell it what should I buy? I would not feel comfortable spending more than $20,000 on a new or used car.
Value of my car in a trade in is probably around $5,000.

First off, congratulations on the new arrival! Very exciting times for you and the fiance.
Second, you shouldn't rush into any rash decisions, especially one as large as this. When the time comes, see if you can get a baby seat into the back of the G6. If so, then there is no reason to do anything, since the fiance has an SUV to use for family duty.
If not, then there are lots and lots of choices for you, both new and used. Poke around the site here at Edmunds and see what appeals to you. Sedan? Wagon? Small SUV? Sporty? AWD? Where do you live? How long is your commute? What's important to you? Use the answer to these questions to guide you to a particular type of car.
Most of all, keep us posted. We're all here to help.

I need some help in selecting a new sedan, for purchase in the next 12 months. Currently, I drive a 2002 Honda Civic EX 4 dr (bought new), with around 85K miles. It has been my ""drive to work"" car and has filled that role very well. But, I want something a bit bigger and more comfortable that can be used on vacations as well as normal everyday driving. The Civic has a pretty rough ride on the road, and as I get older, I want more comfort and a better ride. My wife has a 2001 ES300 that has been great, but I need something for me. Here are the criteria I am working with:
Will buy new, and will keep the car for probably 15 or more years
Out the door price should be under $32K
Good mileage (22-25 in town, 30 on highway), so probably a big 4 cyl would be best engine choice; no turbo - I don't trust the long-term reliability of turbo engines
Cloth interior, not leather
No sunroof, although this is not a deal breaker; I live in Texas, and the days you can open a sunroof here are few; this is money wasted for me
Long term proven dependability/reliability history from the brand; no Hyundai's or Kia's need apply (just don't trust the engineering from them as yet)
Auto transmission, no CVT (I don't know why the auto makers are pushing CVTs so much; I have driven automatics for 44 years and have never had a failure in one; CVTs seem to be a bit unproven for my taste; they must be cheaper than conventional automatics, hence why they are so widespread?)
No touchscreen stuff on the dash - to me this is just another thing to fail; I don't care about Bluetooth and answering a phone through the steering wheel or anything like that; simple is better for me
I know this is a lot of criteria, which is why I have been struggling to find anything I like. Any help you can provide will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

CVTs are widespread because of their fuel economy, not their cheapness. The Altima has had one for several years now and they are extremely reliable. I would check out the Altima and I think you owe the Accord a try. If you hate the 4cyl CVT they make a pretty efficient V6. Just took my 4cyl accord on a road trip and it is extremely comfortable.

Hi Bean,
I think you owe it to yourself to try the Accord with the CVT. The car magazines have called it the best CVT made, because it feels somewhat similar to a regular auto. The reason people are switching to the CVT is because it gets c. 2-3 more mpg than a regular auto.
I have a 2013 Accord EXL navi, and I love it. Best car I've ever owned. I previously owned a 2002 Accord LX, and we still own our 2008 Accord EXL navi. As you can see, I love Honda Accords. They give you good reliability and very good engineering at a fair price. Built in the USA at a huge factory in Ohio, and the team members there do a very good job.
What's impressive is that the ""base"" Honda Accord LX has lots of stuff that were only on the high end models just a few years ago, such as dual zone climate control, bluetooth, advanced engine, etc. The new Accord has great interior room, excellent visibility, the best safety and crash ratings of any midsize car (check out the video from the insurance institute on youtube), plus the mpg will probably be about the same as your little Civic. Seriously, I don't know what kind of hwy mpg you get in your Civic, but I've been getting 34-38 in our 2013 Accord.
Since you don't want a sunroof, the LX model probably has everything you need, including an ok stereo, and it lists for $23,545. The discounts aren't quite as big on the Accord as some other midsizers like the Camry, but you should still be able to get c. $2000 off of list. Even with tax and fees, you should be c. 8000 below your budget. If you need to finance, Honda has 0.9 financing for 5 years. In other words, it's a buyer's market.
Clearly I love Hondas, but I have to say that your feelings about KIA and Hyundai are misplaced at this point. Their reliability is very close to Honda, and imho probably a little better than Ford.
For reasons of design/features/performance/safety/quality I still would go with the Honda, but there are a lot of good other choices, including the Ford Fusion, Mazda6, etc.
Good luck with your search! Hope you'll let us know if you test drive something....

Another one to check out is the Mazda6, which has a conventional 6 speed AT. I am not sure if the base model (no nav) has a touch screen, but I don't think so. You could get one of the lower-end trims with cloth and have a very nice car for under $25k.

Thanks for the suggestions. Yesterday, I went to a Toyota dealer and looked at the Camry SE. It had a touchscreen for the audio stuff, and the salesman said all Camrys have touchscreens. I went ahead and drove the SE, and the ride was better than my Civic, but still seemed a bit rough. I briefly drove an XLE and that ride was better, but not enough to make me write a check. The headroom in the XLE seemed a little tight, probably due to the sunroof, which I think can be deleted from a LE model. I guess a lot more people want the touchscreen than not. But, I'm not going to buy a car with one unless I absolutely have to.
The Mazda 6 also has a touchscreen that is standard, even on the Sport (base) model. It's discouraging to not be able to find what you want in a car, but I understand the reasoning behind putting something in either all or none of the cars built. It doesn't make me ready to buy, however
Thanks again for the suggestions, and it anyone has any more, they will be greatly appreciated.

Since you don't want a touch screen and almost all new mid-sized sedans have one these days (except some you won't consider, e.g. Sonata and Optima), one option is to buy a CPO car with low miles and extended warranty. An older design is less likely to have a touch screen, and you'll save the upfront depreciation on a new car. And it will look and drive like new with a warranty that might be longer than the new car warranty.

Good suggestion - thanks. That did cross my mind when I started the process. I guess I also need to go look at a Sonata at a Hyundai dealer. I really shouldn't rule it out without looking at them and researching the reliability more. One of the reasons I really don't want to buy a Kia Optima is that my local Kia dealer (who I visited with a friend who test drove a Soul) doesn't give off a good vibe. Lots of emphasis on financing with them (even before a deal is close to final), and the service department is small and cramped. There are a couple of Hyundai dealers within a reasonable drive, and I bet they are much more customer friendly.
I do appreciate everyone's help.

Bean: A Hyundai Sonata should be very reliable, and offer very good performance and value. It has only one big drawback, as far as I know, which are large blind spots in the rear. You may not realize it, but you've been spoiled by your current Civic as far as visibility goes. The midsize car with the best visibility is the Accord, with the Mazda6 and Camry next, and the others fairly far down the list after that. The Optima, otherwise an excellent car, doesn't have good rear visibility because of the thick rear roof pillars. Ben

The greenhouses of the Accord and Legacy are pretty similar IMO. The Camry has a pretty thick C pillar, and the Mazda6 isn't much different from the Sonata in rear visibility. Besides the Accord and Legacy, the Passat has a pretty tall greenhouse with a thin C pillar.

I've had a 2006 Dodge Stratus since I graduated college. It's nothing special, but it has treated me well and I've always been happy with it. I recently became aware of some expensive repairs that will need to be made (possibly costing over $1000) and I'm wondering if it makes sense to start looking into getting a new car rather than sinking more money into this one, as it has over 100k miles on it.
I don't have a budget yet, as I really haven't done much research, but I am totally open to buying a used older model sedan. I want something practical, reliable, and relatively fuel efficient. What kind of budget should I be looking at here?

We need to know some parameters. Budget, size (compact, sedan, hatch?), preferences if any as to make (Chrysler, Toyota, Hyundai?).

One of the reasons I really don't want to buy a Kia Optima is that my local Kia dealer (who I visited with a friend who test drove a Soul) doesn't give off a good vibe. Lots of emphasis on financing with them (even before a deal is close to final), and the service department is small and cramped.

Good call. What we've seen across most brand is that, if you have a good dealership, with a good service department, you are probably OK. However, if the dealership isn't giving off a good vibe, and you have an issue that should be covered under warranty, you're not going to get the support you'd like on making a claim under warranty instead of out-of-pocket. A good dealership will look at the history, other complaints, etc., and back you up. If the dealership isn't making you feel like a valued customer before you've even purchased, there are many options.

My guess is that it takes about $5000 to get an OK used midsize car these days. And even at that budget, you'll have to make compromises. Cars at that price might not be any better than your Stratus.
But maybe a low mile Buick Century or similar from a decade ago might work. Or a maybe a Pontiac G6 sedan. Maybe an older Ford Fusion would work.
You're probably not going to like my recommend, but maybe see if you can skip used and go all the way to new. You might be happier in the long run. An old used car you buy now will likely need major repairs or even replacement in a few years. If you go new, knock on wood, you're probably set for about ten years.
And new cars are significantly safer, more fuel efficient, and just better in every way than old used cars.
For instance, a 2013 Honda Fit with Auto trans can be had for c. $16,000, with 0.9% financing available for 5 years.
The epa says the Fit should save you about $600 in gas each year over a 2006 Stratus, which obviously adds up to c. $6000 over a decade.
Just a thought.

I just earned an ""Ancient Membership Badge""! No kidding. Now doesn't that make me feel old. It says: ""Ancient Membership. Nobody remembers a time when this person wasn’t a member here.benjaminhYou earned this badge 6:10PM39 people have earned this badge.""
Well, hello to my 39 ancient brothers and sisters....lol.
Anyway, with all my annoying age (49, actually) and wisdom, I'm going to try to make the case yet again for why a new car can sometimes be even cheaper than used in the long run.
johnvantine, as we know, is looking for a car. Say he buys a low mile (c. 80k) 2004 Buick Century owned by a little old lady from Pasadena. Just say that he buys it for $5000, and then drives it for 5 years with maintenance and repair costs of about $1000 a year for 5 years. At the end of that, at c. 140k (assuming it lives that long), the car is dying and he has to get another one.
Take inflation out of the equation, and say that in 5 years John is able to get another low mile beater for $5k, with another 5 years of life and $5k in maintenance and repairs.
Over ten years, in this scenario, he's spent. c. $20k on buying and repairing and maintaining his used cars.
What if instead he walked into his local Mazda dealer and got a brand-new 2014 Mazda3 sedan with an auto trans for what CarsDirect says it can be had for: c. $17,500. He finances it with Mazda for 1.9% over 5 years, and so interest costs are minimal, and in fact probably less than inflation.
Good new cars these days, like Mazdas, require very little in maintenance and repair in their first 10 years if they are well cared for. For instance, back in 2002 I bought a new Accord LX, which I kept for 8 years and drove about 95,000 miles. That whole time I had no repairs whatsoever. Maintenance mainly consisted of lots of oil changes (at c. $35 a pop at the dealer), one set of tires (nicer than the original tires, they were something like $900 with a puncture warranty), and one set of brake pads (a couple of hundred iirc).
In other words, and some may dispute me on this, there's a chance someone could take a new car today, drive it ten years at c. 10,000 miles a year and have maintenance costs of c. $2500. Perhaps that's optimistic, but I'm not sure. I've now owned my 2008 Accord for more than 6 years, and the story has been exactly the same so far--lots of oil changes, one set of tires for c. $1000, and a set of brake pads that actually Honda gave us under warranty because the originals squeaked a little.
Anyway, for now I'm going to stick with my story that the new route also leads to spending about $20,000 over ten years for purchase and maintenance.
So it seems like a tie, right? Wrong.
A 2004 Buick Century gets an epa rated 21 mpg combined and has an estimated annual fuel cost of c. $2400
A 2014 Mazda3 gets an epa rated 34 mpg combined and has an estimated annual fuel costs of c. $1450.
In other words, you save about $950 a year in gas with the Mazda3. Over ten years, obviously, that's more than 9000 bucks.
But hold on, there's more: resale. In 5 years, as the 2004 Century dies, you'll be lucky if it has resale of c. $1000, and let's just say that when the next beater dies in 10 years it's the same. So total resale value with the used route might be c. $2000.
A ten year old Mazda3, however, which is well maintained and cared for, is likely to have pretty good resale value even in the year 2024. Just for comparison, the Edmunds used vehicle estimator says that a 2004 Civic EX in Clean condition with 100k miles is today worth about $5000 in a private party sale. The 2014 Mazda3 is a larger, safer, more powerful, and really much more impressive car than the Civics of old, and it might be worth as much as 7 or 8 thousand in 10 years.
Anyway, that's what this Ancient member wants to do to waste time tonight and avoid work: tilt at windmills trying to prove again that new cars can sometimes be cheaper than used in the long run.
Total savings going for a new car and using these numbers is, I think, c. $14,000....

^ I think the assumption that you'll spend $1000/yr on a used car is all wrong. Who would buy such a car in the first place? Yes, the maintenance might be a bit more than new, but not $1000/yr more. You want to get a car in the sweet spot of its reliability 80-120K vs. depreciation.
You could buy a 10 yr old Mazda 3, drive it for 2 years and resell for about the same money and not spend any on maintenance. You could do the same with a Civic but you'll have more money tied up since resale values are higher on the Civic.
The only way a new car is ""cheaper"" than used is if you do an apples-oranges comparison.
In 2009 I bought a 2006 TSX for $18,500 (a car that stickered for $31K). Five years later it is still worth $10,000K and I spent zero more than I would have on a brand new car.
What you want to find is a private party sale (dealer mark up negates a lot of the savings) on a model that has good reliability ratings but has high depreciation.

Yes, if you're _really _lucky, you could buy a 10-year-old Mazda3 or Civic and not spend any money on maintenance in 2 years. But you're just as likely if not more likely to spend some bucks in those two years. A 10-year-old car will have 120k-150k miles on average. At that age and mileage, lots of stuff can fail or wear out... brakes, cat converters, struts, alternators, fuel pumps, electronics, ignition coils, clutches, even auto trannies if you're real unlucky.
I bought an 8-year-old Mazda6 this past summer. It seemed to be in great condition, well treated and maintained by its lone owner. I've already spent $1000 in repairs on it, for a failed alternator, fuel pump, and rear hatch struts. And those fuel pumps are pricey buggers!
With a 10-year-old car, expect that anything can fail at any time, and budget accordingly.

You're welcome!
And, as I said, it really is true to my experience. From the early 1990s until the 2008 I owned a series of used cars that I got from my family or bought, including an old Chevy, a 1987 VW Jetta, and a 1988 Oldsmobile 98. Those old cars were in the shop all the time, not only costing a lot of money, but a lot of wasted time, stress, and aggravation.
When I added all of my maintenance and repair receipts up, and combined that with the purchase prices, I realized that if I could have gone back in time I would have been much better off in every way if, back in the early 1990s, I just got myself a new Civic or even a base Accord.
Anyway, good luck. And no matter which way you go, hope you'll update us.

johnvantine: If you decide to consider new, in addition to the Mazda3 you might consider the Honda Civic. There are still some 2013 models of the Civic left on the Honda lots around the country, and you might be able to get c. $1500 off of the list price plus get 0.9% from Honda for 5 years. The Civic gets slightly lower mpg at 32 combined than the Mazda3, which gets 34 mpg combined. That translates into a difference of only about $100 a year.

I have a different point of view than biker4. Over time, cars are often our biggest expense in life, right after housing. Paying over time allows you to get a better car that will last longer. If someone has saved c. $5000, at this point that will probably only buy a so-so used car, and, as people have said, you're likely to have repairs and maintenance of c. $1000 a year. And then in c. 5 years or so, you might need to start the process all over again.
But if you can buy a good new car, and finance it over 5 years, you might not need another car for a long as 10 years.
Low interest financing allows the purchase of a decent car that will last longer. Some people are well enough off to pay cash for their new car up front. I was even fortunate enough to be in that situation the last time I got a car, but I decided instead to pay about half with my trade in and cash, and finance the other half with Honda at 1.9%.
In this economy, a lot of people don't have the whole purchase price up front, but a reasonable new car in relation to income can still make a lot of economic sense in the long run imho.

Agreed. Over the last 20 years I've bought 3 new cars and have had payments for 11 of the 20 years. I have 1 more year of payments on my current car and after that I'll again be payment-free for awhile. As I've bought reliable cars overall, my repair expenses have been roughly one more year's worth of payments. So by the end of this year I'll have made car payments for roughly 13 of 21 years, including repairs.
There's also my brother's tactic: Buy a car (new or used) and pay it off. When you're done paying it off, as you're budget is used to the payments, keep making them to a savings/investment account. Use the fund to cover repairs or the purchase of your next car. My brother is always making payments but he's making them to himself & buys his cars from the fund and has no need to finance any more. It helps that he doesn't live beyond his means; i.e. he's driving standard compact or midsize sedans v. a luxury brand.

The engines themselves should be ok. It's everything else that breaks down and malfunctions like electronics and computers. If it's a vehicle your relative really likes and plans on keeping for a long time, then they should budget for an extended warranty that covers everything, for as long as they can as repairs won't be cheap.

This is why a base model car with a manual transmission (if you can get one that's not a tin can or stripped to nothing these days) is your best bet for frugal driving. Often you can get some very nice cars for not a lot of money like this. The Chevy Cruze comes to mind immediately. It's meh with automatic - just doesn't stand out at all, but manual makes it a blast to drive. Even the humble little Honda Fit is transformed into a much better car.
Something like a BMW? Game-changing. Inexpensive, nothing to break, and drives like a video game. Diesel just makes it even better.

The Accord LX auto has an msrp of c.$23,545 and you should be able to get a discount of about $2000 pretty easily. Worth a test drive imho. The LX has a lot of stuff standard that just a few years ago were only on higher end models, like: back up camera, dual zone climate control, direct injected engine, bluetooth, etc. Plus the Accord has the highest safety ratings on the small offset crash test of any midsize car.

Hey scotty49,
The Verano is perfect for power as well as luxury. It gets 32 mpg hwy so that means fewer fill ups. The StabiliTrak is the very best so you're in control when it comes to maneuvering. It's also equipped with a 2.0L ECOTEC turbo engine with 250 horsepower.
The Malibu is still a great vehicle to consider still! Let us know if you have any more questions in regarding the Verano or Malibu.

The Verano is smaller than the other two and likely to be more expensive, but will check all three of your criteria. You might be able to get an Acura TSX with a discount in the same ballpark. The Acura ILX is a direct competitor to the Verano but it's down on power (but much better on gas mileage).

I looked at the Ford Fusion and while it was a nice car, the problem was that it lacked that extra bit that made it fun.
I ended up buying a 2104 Mustang. Best decision I ever made in buying a car other than my 1967 Mercedes (still miss that car). 305HP, RWD, great power, even at high elevations, and the best thing of all was the insane price that I got it for.
Seriously consider manual. Automatic is also fine, but manual is a blast to drive.
Get it in any case as a base model. You don't want the extra bling or pleather or most of all, that Ford Sync nonsense. Keep it simple. If you do want to add something, only add the Ruby Red or Got to Have it Green paint as it makes the car look much better (three stage pearlescent paint for only a few hundred more is a no-brainer).
Mustang V6: $23420
Actual selling price: $18748 (Truecar, Los Angeles area - $19K is common all over the U.S.)
To put that in perspective, that's $2000 more than a base model Corolla with nothing on it.
I get 24mpg combined in heavy rush hour traffic. 30 on the highway for long trips is actually possible. And when you need to move, it has the same power to weight ratio as a Audi A4 or a Cadillac CTS. ie - it absolutely flies. Handling is also worlds better than the Fusion. The Fusion is a nice car, but it doesn't make you love to drive it.
And it's quiet, too. Surprisingly so. It's probably the most refined V6 Ford's ever made.
Next year's model will be selling for MSRP due to demand, so the value will be on the outgoing 2014s.

I think it's perfectly fair. The original poster did mention the Fusion but also mentioned that he lived at very high elevations and needed more power. I test drove the Fusion at the time and it was a very nice car. It really was. But the Mustang simply stole my heart. It's just built better and goes faster and is much better handling. For less money. 130 more HP also was more than noticeable. I drive a stretch of mountain road every day to work and a Malibu or Verano or similar is OK. But it doesn't fly up the road. Not even close.
The clutch is fantastic. The shifter is a bit notchy, but that's part of its charm. It feels just that tiny bit crude and unrefined like you'd expect a sporty car to be. But it's all a very nice illusion, really. It handles great and is very smooth. They've done a great job at making it feel like a muscle car without actually driving like one. It hums along like any other car on the highway. Until you hit the gas hard and it roars to life, that is 
Go drive the Fusion and the Mustang, even with both having automatic, and the choice becomes a lot clearer.
Plus, as a bonus, the Mustang and Fusion are built by UAW labor. They take immense pride in what they build at that plant in Flat Rock, MI. as it's one of the last ""Big 3"" facilities in the U.S. GM has moved almost everything to Mexico and Canada. Even if you don't buy a Mustang, at least don't buy a GM. Too much baggage at this point.

This person pretty much recommends a Mustang or Crown Vic for everyone no matter what they are looking for. What is your budget for a vehicle? Do you want mid-sized? If you will consistently be in mountain driving I think a 6 cyl. will serve you best. We had a Nissan Maxima that sailed over mountains with ease. It wasn't the greatest in snow but did well enough for the kind of winters we have. If snow is a factor consider a Subaru Legacy or the smaller Impreza for all wheel drive. If there is only sometime snow you might look at the Honda Accord, either 6 or 4 cyl. We travel over the Eastern mountains quite often and our 4cyl Accord does just fine. Knowing your driving parameters will help. Have you driven Malibu, Fusion, and Verano yet?

I've actually recommended dozens of cars over the years. About the only thing I don't recommend is GM stuff as it's as bland and soulless as a Toyota. And half as reliable. If you want a small rocket to get over mountains and that also is FWD, you might also consider a Mini. If you have more money, a couple of year old A4 or C class is also a great option. But upkeep is a bit rude on most of the entry-level luxury cars.
As for myself, my final choice came down to a Fusion, a Mustang, and a Mini. I decided that bling was meaningless as it was primarily for driving to work and back. Note - if I had 5K more on my possible loan, I'd have bought C class with manual a couple of years old. The Mustang is nice, but it is a cheapskate car. Loads of fun, an amazing deal for the money, but no, it's not in the league of a BMW or Mercedes. It shouldn't be for $20K.

Hi digity: Welcome!
For a hatchback for around $7k, I'd recommend a c. 2007 Mazda3 hatchback. If you can find one in good condition with maybe c. 80,000 miles, it might go for about that much. Mazdas are usually fairly reliable.
But, you might also consider buying new. If you buy a c. 7 year old used car now, you'll have increasing bills for maintenance and repair. And if, when the car is about 12 years old and has c. 140,000, it needs so many repairs that you're back on the market for another used car, you might not come out ahead in the long run over new.
With a small downpayment, and low financing provided by the dealer, you might consider buying a new Mazda3, Honda Civic, or similar. A new car, obviously, will only need routine maintenance like oil changes for quite some time. And, with good maintenance a little luck, it should go for c. 10 years and c. 100,000 miles without needing much.

digity: Here's another suggestion. Right now there's an oversupply nationwide of new midsize cars, and so a ""price war"" has broken out. In my market of Louisville, the following midsize cars are being advertised for sale for c. $19,000 with 0% financing: Nissan Altima, Hyundai Sonata, Toyota Camry. I'm a Honda man myself, but the Accord costs about $2000 more, and so if you're on a tight budget it's hard to beat the ""extra value meal"" found in, say, an Altima.
And a new Altima, believe it or not, gets significantly higher mpg than a 7 year old Mazda3. It's also a lot safer. And believe me, Nissan, or Hyundai, or Toyota will try to work with you to make it possible for you to drive one starting today, should you choose.
To get the lowest price,look at the newspaper ads, or the online dealer specials, or just send them an email and ask what the lowest price would be for a base model, and ask what financing they have. With competitive quotes you probably will get close to the 19k that these cars are selling for in my city....Just a thought.

For a coupe, try the Civic. They tend to be a little less expensive than the sedans. For pre-2006, try to get an EX, as those come with ABS (also a moonroof).
For an inexpensive hatch, if you can find a 2004-6 Elantra GT in good condition, that is a very nice car for those years. They can be had with ABS (and moonroof) but those are fairly rare. I have a 10-year-old GT and it's held up very well over 10 Minnesota winters and nearly 100k miles. It's also roomy for a compact, actually is rated mid-sized in interior volume. And has a fold-flat rear seat so can hold a lot of cargo.
Both the Civic and Elantra use a standard DIN slot for radio, so should be easy to replace.

I'm hoping for a coupe or hatchback/5 door over a sedan (but sedan is okay). Definitely want to stay away from big cars (Acura RL and Chrysler 300 are my last two cars).

Interesting (the whole buying new versus old)... the thing is we're already set on buying the 2014/5 MDX as our primary vehicle since we're starting a family and we don't want two car payments.
This second car (I'm posting about) would be just for me and one of my top priorities is that it's fun to drive.... and that I need it to get me to and from clients around the region once or twice a week. I don't plan on keeping it more than a couple years as this is just a placeholder car until I decide how selfish I want to be with a growing family (I'm eyeing the BRZ or Model S as my next real car).

Since you're driving clients in it, another fun-to-drive hatch that can be had for under $7k is the Mazda6 hatch. Plenty of room for 4 adults, fun to drive, good looking (IMO), hauls a lot of stuff (fold-flat rear seat). Can get it with a stick, even a V6 + stick, but sticks are rare. Would be a better car to haul clients in than a Civic or Elantra (or Fit). I'd stay away from coupes if I were you if you have to haul clients in the back seat. Mazda6 doesn't have as good of fuel economy as the smaller cars, but if you're only using it 1-2 times a week, a few mpg might not make a big difference.

You can currently case lease a new Mini Cooper for c. $179 a month. With downpayment I think it comes to c. $8000 over 3 years, which is close to your budget.
Or, a new Honda Fit Hatchback can be leased for c. $149 a month for 3 years, which with downpayment comes to about $7000.
Each of these models is about to have an all-new model introduced, which is probably why lease rates are relatively low.

Clients adds a whole other level to the mix. I'd actually go older and (semi) classic, then. Something like a mint condition BMW 318ti or Mercedes C230K similar (with manual) would be a good choice and you'd have enough money left over to keep it running.
http://www.318ti.org/forum/showthread.php?t=39438
4-5K is typical for something like this. Yes, the rims are a bit ugly, but it's just an example of many out there.
Note - manual is a must as it's about the only major part of these two cars to go wrong. A broken BMW or Mercedes automatic is a lot of money to fix vs a clutch. And automatic is no conversation piece, either.

Since you don't want a car payment (thus a lease is out), probably a used Toyota Corolla or Matrix would have the best fuel economy, least depreciation and most reliability. That's letting go of the fun factor though. Otherwise, a used Elantra or Mazda is probably your best bet.

I've driven both and for me the CVT was much quieter than the 5-speed stick, the engine revved lower and it seemed there was more sound insulation in the CVT model--not sure if that's the case, but it seemed to be. When I drove them, it was a 5-speed anyway--maybe is a 6-speed now, if so that could make a difference. Also, the CVT delivered better FE for me than the 5-speed, and I think that is reflected in the EPA ratings also. The stick was more fun of course, but if I got an Impreza I'd go with the CVT because of lower noise and better FE.

I am looking for a new car that has good fuel economy, decent to better acceleration power, good reliability and safety for preferably around or under 17k. I am slightly flexible on price as I have already gotten approved for a loan for 25k at my bank but don't want to actually go that high. I am willing to look into used as well.
I have had a Honda Civic for the last 11 years and have had a great time with it but feel its time to get a new car. I won't be trading it in but will be giving it to someone. I am not opposed to another Honda but if another choice would serve better, like the Mazda3 hatchback, I'd love to hear it. Also, are certain years better than others in terms of recalls/engineering (such as, maybe to start in '12 of a model because that's where a significant change happened)?
As an aside, I have had bad experiences at dealerships this last month where I was yelled at across a lot, chased down as I was trying to leave, and had people start swarming my car before I had even finished driving into a parking space. I am leery of entering another lot so narrowed choices would be great.

If you like hatchbacks, the Focus is a very nice choice. You can also get good deals and the dealers, well, there's almost no ego there as it's a Ford. You can get a Focus SE hatchback for about $15.5K after rebates. I'd choose the tricoat paint (blue is amazing, red is classy, both will last 3x as long as standard paint, well worth the extra $400) and the handling package. Truecar says that will end up at $16,542.(ie - huge incentives) You actually don't want the extra sync and lighting effects and so on as it's just more to break.
Just the paint and suspension upgrades.
I've driven both the Mazda 3 and the Focus and it's a stark difference. The 3 is plastic and very dated in its feel, and especially the interior. The Focus is just better all around until you get the the Mazda Grand Touring, which is better. But at $25K, its just silly money. $16.5K and almost as good is why the Ford gets my vote.

I would drive both the new Civic and the Mazda3. Try the Focus too but for reliability I personally prefer Honda and Mazda. Tell dealers that you have not completely narrowed down your choices yet and are interested in a test drive. Not all of them will be badly behaved. Are you more interested in a hatch or a sedan? That will help. Read Consumer Reports Auto issue basic info and to help you narrow down what you are interested in.

If I had that kind of money and was looking for a car as you described, my top choices would be:
2012+ Mazda3i w/Skyactiv (I think you need a 2013+ to get a hatch with Skyactiv) - get the 6MT for the most fun
2010+ Golf - again go for the 5MT for more fun. The Golf, made in Germany (at least until the 2015 comes here), has been reliable, and it's fun to drive and has perhaps the nicest interior in the small car class. And it's easy to find one with heated seats, if you live in a cold climate. I'd get a CPO car for the extra warranty, those are pretty easy to find.
2015 Base Fit - looks like a great little car, although I haven't driven it yet--just looked at it at the auto show. Has a 6MT, although 6th isn't very tall so engine noise could be an issue. The automatic is a CVT, though. Should do very well on crash tests also, given it's Honda's latest design.
2013+ Elantra GT. Can probably find a used base model for ~$17k, and the 6MT is smooth as is the 6AT. Nice little car, well equipped even in base form e.g. alloys and heated seats are standard. For 2014 it has a more powerful engine, but those will likely cost more than $17k unless you can get a real good deal.
The Focus SE hatch might be another possibility, but reliability has been poor and the rear seat is pretty tight (although so is the Mazda3's), and it has a 5MT vs. the 6MT on the Mazda3i, Fit, and Elantra GT so I don't see any reason to go with a Focus vs. the others.

Those all are great choices, but I don't think the poster specified MT. All of them are available in automatic or CVT. I have the Honda Accord CVT and actually can't tell the difference from an AT, so I wouldn't let that put you off. And if you want good fuel economy, most CVTs are better than most AT vehicles. Really drive a few and see what you like best and feel is the best bang for your buck.

No, he didn't say MT... but didn't specify automatic-only either. So I was giving my 2 cents on that subject. I think the stick is the way to go on all the cars I listed with the exception of the 2015 Fit. I've read that 6th gear is the same ratio as 5th on the current Fit, so RPMs (and engine noise) won't benefit from the extra cog. And those were the main reasons I didn't get a Fit a few years ago (got a used 328Ci instead  ). So engine noise and RPMs should be significantly reduced with the CVT... as will the fun.

I've driven the Mazda and Fit and Focus and... I drove them all 9 months ago. And they all were like comparing different brands of American Cheese. After a while, it was nit-picking over small differences and none of them really felt like anything more than an econobox. My advice is get whatever is cheapest for the level of equipment that you get. Note that the number of gears in the transmission means nothing in a car this small as the 6th gear in most of them is designed to get high EPA ratings alone and never ever useful for anything other than perfectly flat pavement.
Myself, I personally would get a base model (zero options) Mustang as one can be had for $19K and comes with the same options as most upper-trim economy cars. If you're just looking at yourself or two people in it, you'll never even care about the rear seat. It's what I bought since I only had a budget of $20K and wanted the most power and fun that I could manage. Dirt cheap fun for only a couple of thousand more than a basic Corolla.
Note - you can also get a Camaro from time to time for $20K and a Challenger for $22K... All three are amazing deals for the money if you're just using it to get yourself around.

No, Corolla is fine, but Toyotas tend to be pricey even used. And unless you get the new one they are not as good on fuel economy as the others. Stellar reliability as always.

I think it's because there isn't anything exciting from Nissan or Toyota. Maybe the Juke might fit the bill but it's tiny and pricey. There are so many other more fun choices from other brands in my opinion.

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to decide between the 2014 Mazda 3 iTouring and the 2015 Honda Fit EX. From what I understand they are both excellent cars receiving high reviews. I've test driven the Mazda, and I really enjoyed it. I can't test drive the Honda yet because no dealers around me will get them in for at least another two weeks. For now I've decided to put my decision on hold until I can drive the Honda, but I still thought it would be a worthy question to ask. I'm pretty confident that most of my decision-making process revolves around apples to oranges comparisons, namely style versus utility. The Mazda is super sexy although I've been driving a 1999 Toyota Corolla for about 12 years, so pretty much everything on the market right now is sexy to me. Still I'm trying not to let the Mazda dazzle me so much that I ignore the utility of the Fit. The Fit is an odd-looking creature, yes, but it has high reliability ratings, and the cargo space is unmatched for a small car. Is there anything I'm missing that would make one car a much better decision than the other, or am I right that it pretty much boils down to personal priorities?

You're correct that this an apples-to-oranges comparison, in some respects. But they are both small, fuel-efficient hatchbacks, so maybe not so odd a comparison. And in fact I have both on my list when I get my next car in 2016, except I'd go for a previous-gen Mazda3i with Skyactiv and a base Fit.
You really need to take each car for a long test drive, preferably back-to-back, to get an idea which you'd be happiest living with every day. I haven't driven the new Fit yet, but I've driven the new Mazda3i and I loved it. (But I loved the old Mazda3 too.) The Fit might be fun to drive too, but I'd be surprised if it were as fun to drive as the Mazda3. It could come down to how important cargo utility is for you vs. ride & drive. You didn't mention whether you want stick or automatic, but if automatic then it's the Mazda3's excellent 6-speed vs. the new CVT in the Fit. Some people don't like the feel of a CVT and they can sap performance, but maybe Honda did a good job on this CVT.
One potentially big factor is that the Mazda3i Touring hatch is over $2500 more list price than the Fit EX.

My first choice of vehicle would be a Ford truck, but I just don't think I will be able to make that happen. My second choice of vehicle would be a sedan, Camry is a good example. If I can't make a full-sized sedan a reality, then a mid-sized sedan would be next, such as the Chevy Cruze. If I must settle for a compact car, then I really want one that gives me the most bang for my buck. Something that is on-sale, and offers great incentives. Thank you for your help.

First thing to do is to decide what car you want. If price is the main concern, I think the Nissan Versa or the Smart4Two are the cheapest cars sold in the U.S.
That doesn't mean they're good cars (they aren't), just the cheapest. I would also look at how much they cost to operate and repair, as that figures into it as well.
From what has been suggested, I think a Honda Fit is a good idea. It's versatile. It's very reliable (Hondas always are) and likely to last a long time, It's inexpensive to operate, too.
Look here...http://www.edmunds.com/tco.html?mktcat=tco&kw=true+cost+to+own&mktid=ga56677242&gclid=CjwKEAjw9LKeBRDurOugs43jnlgSJACUXqHx0OTyseVCiiM8ps88tf3EF_8Mg43oNMVoCpRpns8HSRoCB2Dw_wcB
Not sure about financing these days. I know up until a few years ago, a dealer could finance just about anyone for anything with no money down. But, I understand things have tightened up just as quickly. So, probably not a bad idea to scrape together at least 10% down before walking into a dealership.
Even a lease is going to require first month's payment, license fees, lease inception fees, etc.
Good luck and let us know how it goes.

Right now I think the best bang for your buck out there is the 2014 Sonata GLS. Hyundai has big incentives on it to move them out for the new 2015s. It's a mid-sized sedan but in the EPA full-sized class based on interior room. You can easily find these for under $18k nicely equipped (get the Preferred Package with alloys and heated seats). I've leased one since November 2012, mostly for my wife but I get to drive it quite a bit too. It's a good highway cruiser, has a smooth ride and gets excellent fuel economy on the highway especially if you keep it under 70. Comfortable driver's seat, especially with the heated power seat in the Preferred Package. Doesn't have as crisp of handling as something like the Mazda6 or Accord, but costs a lot less. Another plus is the 5-year bumper to bumper warranty and 10-year powertrain warranty.
You might be able to find a great deal on a closeout 2014.5 Camry too if you prefer that car. IMO I prefer the Sonata for its styling (inside and out) and warranty, but the Camry is a solid choice also for a commuting car.
I'd stay away from the Cruze if I were you. Much tighter inside than a Sonata or Camry, FE is no better unless you get the diesel or high FE model, has very sloppy steering IMO, and price-wise I don't think you'll save very much. Also Consumer Reports says the Cruze has been unreliable.

Hi, can you help me choose a car to buy based on my criteria? I recently accepted a new job out of town (it's a local area trucking job), and my 22 year old Ford truck is not suited for the commute. I want to buy a new car this week. But my time to do research is limited. I am hoping some of you here are knee-deep in research, and can share what you know. My price range is 16K-18K. I want the most car I can get after rebates and special incentives. I have excellent credit so I will be able to qualify for 0% financing if it is offered. My first choice of vehicle would be a Ford truck, but I just don't think I will be able to make that happen. My second choice of vehicle would be a sedan, Camry is a good example. If I can't make a full-sized sedan a reality, then a mid-sized sedan would be next, such as the Chevy Cruze. If I must settle for a compact car, then I really want one that gives me the most bang for my buck. Something that is on-sale, and offers great incentives. Thank you for your help. My Google search for ""best car deals in July"" really did not help much.

well, of course, a lease doesn't REQUIRE you put that money down. You can roll it into the payment.
Browse truecar.com to get an idea of street prices.
Just to name a couple, a Kia Rio LX sedan with automatic and power package, with msrp of $17,160, is listed there for $15,924. A mazda3 svi automatic with msrp of $18790 is $17432. A mazda2 sport automatic at $16355 list is showing up for $12,380. I think that last one might be your winner.

Q....I didn't know you didn't have to put money down on a lease. I thought it was first and maybe last month's payment, plus bank a licensing fees.

It depends on the state ... but, you can roll most of the up-front costs into the lease; the trade-off is that you'll pay a higher interest rate (money factor) in return.
When I leased my Hyundai last November, I only gave them a check for the first month's payment - everything else was covered by the lease cash that was currently available.

I agree. Also, a base Fit (LX) with CVT (to reduce engine RPMs and noise and for better FE) is $17k, and good luck getting much of a discount on this all-new car. That's very close to what a 2014 Sonata GLS would run, and only a little less than a 2014.5 Camry LE.
Also the OP said ""sedan"", and the Fit isn't a sedan. Although I prefer hatchbacks myself.

True. Then I'd suggest a Hyundai Elantra. A leftover '14 will be $15k or less. You won't get a '14 Camry for that. Elantra is a pretty decent commuter car too.

Actually, because of the big incentives on leftover Sonatas right now, they turn out to be a better deal than the leftover Elantras. And the Sonata is a much nicer car than the Elantra. You might be able to get an Elantra for $15k, with a stick. I think it would be closer to $16k. But a Sonata with the 6AT, much more power and room and more comfortable, wouldn't be much more.
Example of what I mean: at my local dealer, a sign-and-drive 3-year lease on the 2014 Elantra SE (base model) is $189/month. But for the Sonata GLS it's only $10 more per month. For $10 more a month, $360 over 3 years, I'd take the Sonata.

On Fitzmall (for example), the difference is about $1500, base Elantra AT to base Sonata AT. Thus I'd go with the lease... $199/month with nothing up front for 36 months is a great deal for a car like the Sonata.

backy, that is why I have been seriously considering a lease now. Camry, Altima, Sonata are all pretty much readily available for right about that $200 _+ tax (so ~$215/mo) will very little cash up front.

You can get a base model Mustang with nothing on it for 18K right now (just look for the loss leader ads in the local papers). It's an excellent step up from a typical econobox and is great for long commutes. The base model has all of the features most economy cars have at their upper trim levels. The ""base"" stereo is crazy loud, it has alloy wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, power windows, power doors, and on and on. It's as nicely optioned as a normal trim Camry or Accord. It even turns the interior lights off if you forget to do so.
Without a doubt it's the most bang for the buck right now. Ford is dumping them left and right in order to make room for the 2015 re-design, which is only a little better. The new ones are going to be 24K, though, and no discounts. At 6K less, the 2014s are an absolute steal.
I just got 27mpg on mine my last tank and the 305hp makes it a blast to drive. The long wheelbase and high profile 17"" tires also makes for a ride that sorry to say, no Fit or Civic or Focus will match.
Drive one. Then try to not grin.
Yes, it's over the budget. My budget was the same and I drove everything I could - literally dozens of cars. And in the end, I paid the little bit extra for a similar deal. I just couldn't deal with the reality of driving a gutless little tin can after driving big cars and SUVs for years.

For something under $15k, reliable, sleek looking, with as many tech features as possible for that money, have you looked at the Elantra GT? You could get a gently used one for around $15k, albeit probably not with a touchscreen but everything else you listed, and it's a lot more practical than the Veloster. You should also look at the Mazda3i hatch, I've seen these under $15k with low miles--again probably not with a touchscreen. Both of these can be had with a 6MT if you like a stick.Another nice used hatch in this price range is the 2010+ Golf. I see CPO 2013 2-doors and 4-doors for under $15k in my area. These cars, built in Germany, have a good reliability record (unlike some other VWs). The Kia Rio SX is another option, and if you could find one (they're rare) they're really loaded. I have the LX hatch and like it, but it doesn't have Bluetooth and the sound system isn't great. No touchscreen either. I think the SX has that... the EX might have it as an option also. But I think you can get more car with the Elantra GT, Mazda3i, or Golf.The Focus is another thought, but its reliability hasn't been that good. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I think that's a good price for what looks like a loaded GT with 6k miles. Maybe they would negotiate to down to your price?You can get a nicely-equipped Golf (2010+) for under $15k. About the only thing on your list it might not have is a touchscreen. But consider... do you REALLY need that? And how much are you prepared to pay for it? If that touchscreen is important, you might look for a Rio SX. Kind of rare, but a nice infotainment system with touchscreen is standard.

Thanks for all those information guys, really helps me to see clearer.The touchscreen is not that important, it is a plus to me. What I am really looking for is a decent sound system, bluetooth , sirius xm and aux audio.I also meant to ask you guys, how would you negotiate a price with a dealer if it's already under the average price given by KBB ? In addition, do dealer let you take the car to get it inspected by a mechanic ?My issue is that I live in a rather small town (College Station, Tx) and that I 'm looking at used cars in a radius of 250 miles. So it sounds really inconvenient to go check the cars and negotiate since I feel like negotiating involves walking away, coming back several times and so on.Thank you. ",Posts: 21,Member
3651,"
September 2014 ",backy,"
You can negotiate over email and phone. But always get their offers in writing, not just over the phone. Used car prices are often under average KBB. That is only a guide. If you aren't comfortable negotiating with a dealer, I strongly recommend you find someone you trust who is comfortable (family member, friend) and let them help you. Your goal is to get the car you want for the lowest price possible. The dealer's goal is to sell you their car for the highest price possible. But it's up to them to decide what they are willing to sell the car for, not you. So you can offer anything you want. They can always say, ""No thanks."" Just as you can! First, find more than one car that meets your needs. You never want to have only one option. But if you can't do that, at the least don't let the dealer know you want only their car!! Act like you could walk at any time if you don't get your price.What I like to do is let the dealer know that I am willing to buy (or lease) the car for $X today, right now. That X is always less than their asking price, unless they are a no-haggle dealership (some in my area are). I do that even if I think the asking price is reasonable. (Last time I did that for a used car, the salesman just smiled and told me if I wanted to buy one of his new Infinitis, he'd be glad to give me a big discount, but not for the old car I was buying--which was already at a great price.) Have a maximum price in mind when you make your offer. e.g. say the asking price is $16k. Your target is $15k. So you offer $14k. Your goal is to get the car for no more than $15k. If they won't go that low, get up, shake hands, tell them you're sorry you couldn't make a deal, and walk out. (Or do something similar over email.) If they follow you out, or call you later, they'll go lower. (You see why you want someone experienced at this to help you?)About getting a dealer's car inspected... if you buy a car that's still under warranty (like the 2013 Elantra GT you mentioned is), that's not an issue. Even if not under factory warranty, it may have a dealer warranty--that's the law in my state for late-model used cars. If there's no warranty at all, then they should have no problem with your taking it to a mechanic you trust for an inspection. Since you're doing this long distance, I recommend you find a car still under factory warranty (could be a factory extended warranty, i.e. CPO car). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Re financing, you can ask the dealer about their financing options. Some offer good rates.

Check out both banks and dealer rates. Sometimes automakers have special financing available on certain new cars, like 0% or 0.9%. Sometimes you can get a rebate if you don't take their low financing, but other times there is no rebate if you don't take the financing. Banks can offer very attractive rates. Those special rates require good credit. The bank I use for my car loans has a 1.75% fixed rate for 60 months on new cars now, or 2.75% on used cars, for people with good credit. But dealers can have arrangements with multiple lenders and may offer low rates also. Shop around. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

If they left money on table, maybe. Or with a used car, if nice and priced well, just sell it to someone else.

Outside of V8 rumble (hard to do reliably for that budget if you have insurance issues!) not sure what else counts, and it is of course subjective.I would think that spending less on a car and investing in an after market exhaust system might get you what you want.

I'm looking for a small SUV for my wife for when the lease is up on her 2013 Sonata this fall. I went to our local auto show this past weekend and checked out all the small SUVs. Here's my impressions:* HR-V: Looks like a great package--roomy inside, compact outside. Not much power but she doesn't need it for her schlepping around town. Should have excellent FE with the CVT. Should start around $20k for an LX FWD. Might be in short supply initially, but I don't need to buy until late November.* Trax: Roomy enough inside, has fold-flat rear seat with a fold-forward cushion, good headroom. But interior has some cheap bits, and FE is considerably less than the HR-Vs. But I'd take it over the Encore.* Renegade: I don't think my wife will like the Jeep look. And a Fiat under the covers. Hmmm...* CX-5 (2016): Nice package, but starts at $25k. I like it, but my wife will be the main driver.* Forester: Hard to go wrong with it, but also on the pricey side. Standard AWD though.* CR-V: I hate the styling. For what an LX costs, I'd rather get a loaded HR-V.* Escape: I drove an Escape S the other day and liked the handling and how the rear seat folds flat. And price is very reasonable with the usual boat load of Ford incentives.* Sportage, Tucson, Equinox, Terrain, Tiguan... sorry no.* Q3: My favorite. Great value for ~$32k. But my wife already said No, she doesn't want such a ""fancy"" car.There's also used options like the previous-gen CR-V and Forester, a used CX-5, or a CPO Escape.Comments? ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Have her try the Encore. I just got one and I love it. So much nicer than the Trax and it is a perfect schlepping around town vehicle. Seating is high but not too high, good visibility, a breeze to maneuver in and out of tight places, and plenty of room for groceries, dogs, and whatever else you might be carrying. Surprisingly roomy inside for such a small vehicle. The HR-V will be great too but I predict hard to find and no deals. At least that's the way the Fit was its first 2 years out.

The base Encore starts at nearly $26k. For that money, I can probably get a loaded HR-V. An Encore with leather is $30k... pretty close to what the Q3 runs. For a little more, I'd take the Q3. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

""The Encore is probably cross-shopped with the Q3, GLA and X1."" I don't think so. I just looked at the prices of the Q3 and X1. Holy cow! Over 10 grand more than the Encore once you get them decently equipped. I think that's what 's so unusual about the Encore -- it isn't really cross-shopped with anything.

Don't want to argue as you aren't interested anyway. I was talking about the mid level trim Encore which stickers at $27k and GM last month had $2k cash back. That's before negotiating. All I meant is that I don't usually look at vehicles with a price over $30k.  ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Why would you compare a mid-level Encore trim with cloth interior to a Q3 with leather and talk about both being ""decently equipped""?I get it... you really like your Encore. It's probably a great little SUV for most people. It just doesn't float my boat. But if it did, I'd have no problem cross-shopping it with something like the CX-3 and HR-V at the low end, or at the upper end the Q3. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I wasn't comparing. Your original post said you weren't looking for something ""fancy"" so I assumed you meant no leather interior or over $30k. Anyway, one thing to consider when you look at any of these is comfort and noise level. It's hard to find a small vehicle, whether sedan or CUV, that's quiet.

The HR-V looks compelling but I'll reserve judgement until pricing is revealed and it's been through some actual hands-on reviews. I'd be somewhat concerned about engine performance when hauling cargo.As the resident Mitsu proponent I'll put in a mention for the Outlander Sport, which starts at $19,595. The base 2.0 engine (2.4 available) packs more punch that the HR-V's 1.8 and still delivers respectable economy. It has slightly less cargo space but year after year has earned top safety pick rating & KBB rates it among the 10 most affordable SUVs.For financing, leases start @ $179/mo or buy with your choice of a 0% interest rate or $1500 rebate.

The Mitsu might be worth a look based on performance and price, but I'm concerned about availability of dealer service (very few even in the large Twin Cities area) and their future in the USA.I'm not concerned about engine performance on the HR-V. But then, I owned a 100 hp Dodge Caravan I4 3AT for 7 years, and hauled five people and their luggage cross-country a few times in it.  ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Understood about a local dealer situation but I don't really understand the concern about them staying in the US. Unlike Suzuki and some other brands that have shut down US operations, Mitsu actually manufactures vehicles here and has new models coming. Their sales remain at the niche level but have been trending up.Yeah, we are blessed with HP nowadays but I wonder what that Dodge weighed compared to today's 3,000+ pound vehicles. My '93 Mazda had 130HP but only weighed about 2500 pounds. Not sure how many cars are remotely close to that weight (and are larger than a Smart). ","Posts: 1,459",Member

Why would I be concerned? Let's see... their newest model, the 44 mpg Mirage, arguably the worst car sold in the USA, came here about the same time the price of gas plunged. Mitsu's only other car in the USA, the Lancer, is 8 years old. Only one model is made in the USA. Sales were up for 2014, but totaled 77k units. Although the Galant was once one of the best mid-sized cars, Mitsu has no offering in that segment, the most popular for passenger cars in the USA. I owned a 1992 Galant for awhile; it was a good car. Back then, Mitsu was selling about 200k vehicles per year in the USA.A few years ago I almost bought a Saturn--just before they went belly-up. Now I'm glad I didn't. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I had to go over to Youtube to see this, and it will be interesting to see it up close when it becomes available. There is so much ergonomic difference in these types of vehicle -- seat height, width, comfort, layout of the dash -- even the exterior looks different in person. For example, one thing I don't like about my current Accord is that for me it is hard to see where the front ends, and I always wind up about 2 feet short in a parking space because it looks like I'm going to bump into a wall. I can't tell if that would be the case in the HR-V as well. If it has higher seating that might alleviate that problem. It looks very nice inside. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

You have to sit in these types of vehicles to gauge what a tight fit they are. Some are pretty comfortable for the front seat passengers at least. If the HR-V isbased on the Fit it will be pretty snug inside though. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

Imho the new Fit has a surprising amount of room inside for a small car. And since the HRV is stretched in terms of height and length, it should be pretty roomy. Yes, it's small, but look at that video and you might be impressed with the size of the cargo space. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Yes, I sat in the Fit at the auto show and it has an incredible amount of rear seat passenger room. I looked into the locked HR-V and it also appears to have lots of rear-seat room. That plus the magic seats should give it the most usable cargo room in its class. I like the ""small on the outside, big on the inside"" philosophy. The HR-V may be similar in exterior length to a car like the Mazda3, but there's no comparison in interior room. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Update on my search for an SUV to replace my wife's 2013 Sonata that's going off-lease. After looking at lots of small and medium-sized SUVs, new and used, we bought a 2012 CX-7 tonight. 40k miles, exceptional condition (I couldn't find a mark on it anywhere), lifetime powertrain warranty included (dealer tosses that in on all vehicles with less than 60k miles). $13,600 price, $14,900 out the door; got 2.75% 5-year financing from my bank. Wasn't my first or second or third choice, it's an older design, but does everything we need at a very nice price. Nice handling (it's a Mazda after all) and plenty of room. And sharp looking with pearl white paint, tan/black interior, and nice alloys.My first choice was the HR-V, but the lowest price I could get on one of those was $22k + TTL for an LX AWD (no FWD available in my area). Next choice was a 2013+ Escape or 2010+ Equinox, but couldn't find one with less than ~50k miles for much less than $16k + TTL. Also could have gotten a new 2015 Outlander Sport ES 2.0L FWD for $17k + TTL or a new 2015 Rogue Select AWD with Convenience Package for $209/month sign-and-drive 3 year lease, but neither one of those was that exciting to me or my wife.

Backy - congrats. Can you tell me if the CX-7 has the 2.3T or the 2.5 engine in it? We owned a 2010 CX-7 with the 2.3T for 4 years and 60,000 miles. Wife loved the ""zoom zoom"" aspect of the car initially, but the 19"" wheels and tires (ours was a GT trim level) made for a rough ride.Traded it in this past February for a 2015 Outback 3.6R. We got $12,500 in trade, so your price for a car that's two years newer looks pretty solid.Enjoy! ","Posts: 199,247",Moderator

Our CX-7 is the SV (base) model so it has the 2.5L and 17"" wheels. No racer but plenty of power for schlepping around town or highway cruising. The ride seemed fine with the smaller wheels. It was the lowest priced CX-7 from a dealer within 50 miles of us with so few miles. There was another one, a silver 2012 SV, for a couple hundred less but had 14k more miles (2 years of driving for my wife) and had several touched-up scratches and dings, while ours has a color combo we like a lot more and no flaws I could see inside or out. Plus it has remote start--could come in handy once in awhile in Minnesnowta. Gonna pick it up today, and turn in the Sonata next week after I get the front bumper replaced. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Almost time for a new vehicle in our household. Not really narrowed down to specifics yet, but I'll use a couple of vehicles as a starting point.We have been driving manual transmission cars since 1979 until we got our 2014 Versa Note with the CVT. I'm not a huge fan of the CVT, but have learned to tolerate it. We've had nothing but hatchbacks since 2007 and really like that cargo space availability when you fold down rear seats. (I do miss my 4x4 pickup, but that's another story)We've rented a Nissan Rogue and took it on a 1200 mile trip to the Indy 500, and like the larger size of the interior, ride comfort, how it drives, etc. STILL not fond of the CVT.The Kia Soul has caught my eye, and can be had with a 6 speed manual, WITH things like power windows and locks, although the color choices are limited with the manual. (If I could get the red with a stick, I might be there already)A little more than half of our driving is rural, local, small town (not city), and when we're on the highway it's usually at least a 250 mile trip.Oh yea, I LOVE to drive me car and have very little interest in having it park or stop or stay in the lane for me.

After a lifetime of sedans, I'm finally ready for some cargo space and am looking at crossovers/small SUVs. Short drives, so leasing suits me very well. My most recent midsize sedan was really fun and responsive. Now I'm having trouble deciding between a whole lot of unexciting choices: some unattractive, some overpriced, and most underpowered.

I don't think the Mazda CX-5 has AndroidAuto/CarPlay integration yet.Honda does have 2.9% financing on all CR-Vs for 60 months. With a modest downpayment you might be able to buy an EX CR-V for c. $450 a month, but I realize that's $50 a month above your target budget. Aside from the CR-V EX, I don't think there are many entry-level SUVs that have smart phone integration. Toyota's RAV4 doesn't have that on any trim level, not even the top of the line. But I just looked it up, and it seems that starting in 2018 the Nissan Rogue has AndroidAuto on some models. Probably a lease on a Nissan Rogue is in your budget. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Drove a new Subaru Imprezza and was very impressed by it. Excellent mpgs for a CVT and it shifted like a normal auto. Comfortable driver and got it up to speed on the highway rather quickly. Unfortunately after configuring one that fit my needs and wants, came to about $30K which is a bit more than I’m looking to spend on a new vehicle. Would rather cap things at $25K including my trade-in. But knows that might be a bit unrealistic for what I really want. So right now, plan is to keep the Golf and pay off whatever hospital bills my insurance won’t cover. Then, and only then, will I think about another new vehicle. This is all subject to change if the right vehicle comes along. I mean something that I can’t pass up. Since I’m into VW right now, will give the new Jetta a good look. Best warranty in the business now and am hoping with the new model out, they give some super deals in a few months. It’ll just fit in our garage on my side but if and when, will deal with that issue. The new Tiguan is great also but again, on the larger side. And not really into any CPO vehicle but might have to investigate that further going forward. The Sandman  ","Posts: 6,101",Member

My sister is looking for a hatchback to replace her 2004 Elantra GT, which I bought new, gave to my son for college, then he sold to my sister 3 years ago. But it's at the age where a lot of stuff will need work soon and it still has some value (good interior, glossy red paint, well maintained, good rubber), so it's time to move it out of the family. (FWIW my other sister still owns a 2001 Elantra GLS I bought new in October 2000. Pretty good for a car that was $11k new!)I'm helping my sister look for cars. She wants to stay under $10k, wants low miles (under 60k or so), automatic, likes hatchbacks but also likes high FE so doesn't want a CUV/SUV. Some cars I've found from local dealers that seem to fit are:* 2015 Fit EX, 23k, $9999 - Has salvage title but I saw the Carfax and accident pics and the damage looks pretty minor, just the right front corner.* 2016 Fit LX, 31k, $9799 - Just $200 less than the EX plus more miles, so not a good buy I think although not a salvage title so it would still have warranty left.* 2014 Versa Note SV, 43k, $6999 - This is ideal I think for her, low payments, roomy, very well equipped (heated seats, Bluetooth etc.), only downside is salvage title (need to check out the Carfax and pics).* 2015 Sonic LS, 40k, $8,995 - I've driven Sonics as rentals and I liked them, but for the money I think the Note and Fits are better buys.* 2013 Cube, 36k, $8499 - Very roomy, but I think the Note is a better buy (and the Cube is black which she doesn't like).* 2013 Elantra GT, 41k, $9990 - The sentimental favorite, plus it's loaded (panoramic roof, leather etc.) so a good deal IMO. There's many more that fit her parameters, but all with closer to 60k miles. We're going to check out some of the above on Tuesday (holiday weekend). ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I would not buy a vehicle with a salvage title. The Note is a great car but has none of the latest safety features so it will be a hard sell down the road. Either the 2016 Fit, which holds value well, or the 2013 Elantra sound like good buys. ","Posts: 4,677",Member

No salvage titles. If you insist on it, however, they are worth HALF of what a clean one would cost.IMHO, the Fit LX lacks nothing of importance. Still has power everything, bluetooth, and backup cam. Personally, I hate the CVT in the Note and find it dreadful to drive due to the droning it causes. All that said, something is wrong with that Fit LX at that price. Worth more than $11k at dealer auction, so $14k'ish retail. Unless it is not a 2016?That is cheap for the Elantra. I would have suggested $11k as a fair price to pay. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

that comment about salvage titles raises a good question. How much more of a deduct is that vs. a dirty carfax? Use Sandy's Golf as an example, since he is looking into DV. Serious enough shunt to be borderline fix or total. Say they had just decided to total it instead. Someone would have bought it, and done the exact same repair.I think pre-accident trade in value was about 12K? so if you should not pay more than $6K if salvaged, what is the trade in with clean title but dirty carfax?And also why the right car, for the right person, with a salvage title can still be a good buy.

There are a number of risks with a salvage title car--the repairs might not have been well done for one thing. For another, even if you have collision insurance, the insurance company is going to pay very little to total a car that's already been totaled. You could buy it for $10K, drive it two weeks, get hit again, and get a $2500 pay out. ","Posts: 64,482",Member

the insurance issue is certainly something to research.but really, what is the difference between fixing a car in a major accident, and fixing it after branding it as salvage? same repairs. money is a factor too. A newer Audi could receive $25,000 in repairs because of what it is worth otherwise. But a Fit could be totalled because it needed $8,000 in repairs, relatively straightforward bodywork stuff. Plus, salvage could have been theft recovery.regardless, if water was involved, that I would never touch. And having full repair history (and pictures) is a must. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

With the value being lower, no one is going to put the same money into a repair on a totaled car. That’s why it was totaled. It isn’t just the salvage title, it’s what that assumes: minimum repair to get the car roadworthy. ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

We've had our 2018 Mazda CX-3 Grand Touring for a month now and it's my wife's favorite vehicle she's ever owned (and she's had a lot of nice vehicles). She previously had a Miata and wanted something a bit sporty with a bit more room and function -- and the CX-3 hits all the right notes. I do have to agree with those who say the infotainment system is a little complicated. And for those who need more cargo space, it's going to be tight.

Update on car search: The Fit LX is gone. The Elantra GT has an ""engine problem"" so the dealer has pulled it from the market for now. My sister is going to check out the Fit EX and Versa Note SV ($7k) tomorrow. But I found two other good choices: a 2015 Versa Note SV with 41k that's Nissan Certified with a 7 year/100k mile warranty, from a Nissan dealer, for $9995 list, and a 2014 Sonic LT hatch with 36k miles, no accidents or fleet use, for $8950... and both are red, which my sister likes. The Versa Note needs to have prep finished so isn't ready to look at today, or we'd go drive it. I'm steering my sister towards the certified Versa Note, due to the long warranty (vs. salvage title with no warranty), higher seating position than the Fit, and smoother ride than the Fit. Yeah, it's a CVT, but she does almost all in-town driving and is no speed racer, so I don't think she'll mind it. As for new, she wants to stay under $10k if possible, plus wants a hatch or wagon with an automatic. I've checked new hatches under $15k in my area, and they're all Sparks, Fiestas, Mirages, and a couple of Focii. She doesn't like the Focus and the others are too small. If she could wait 9-10 months, I'd sell her my 2016 Forte5 that will have only ~30k miles on it when the lease is up next year, but she needs a car now. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Update: my sister bought the 2014 Sonic LT hatch for $8950, and she got a 5-year/60k bumper-to-bumper warranty for it for $1500 for ""peace of mind"". Financed at 2.99% for 60 months (local bank, dealer couldn't come close to it).The car is pretty loaded, with heated seats, moonroof, hi-zoot audio and touch screen, remote start etc. The rear seat folds flat, which my sister likes. Enough back seat room for adults for short trips, and that's all she needs as she lives alone. It looks ""like new"" except a minor scrape on the front left bumper. Dealer said that was why the price was reduced, and it seemed like a good price for the car. She likes it. I drove it a bit and it seems like a solid, fun-to-drive little car with the 1.4T engine. Although it is a bit dated of a design, it seems to have good crash protection for a small car.She sold her 2004 Elantra GT to the daughter of a friend from her church who needed cheap wheels right away. It was sad to see it leave the family after 14+ years, especially since I'd spent an afternoon detailing it the week before (before I knew she was going to sell it).

This article may be of help: https://www.edmunds.com/car-leasing/monthly-199-lease-deals.htmlThere's several vehicles in that article, including the Civic LX, that you can get a 36-month lease on for under $230 a month, although you may have to put down a little up front. Even the Crosstek is on Edmunds list, but it's the base model with a stick. I see really good leases locally on the Elantra, Impreza, and new Jetta, and for a little more the Sonata and Legacy.

Hi. We are about to have our 2nd child so looking for a little more room and was thinking about a SUV, but which one is the question. I don't know that much about them but would love to get one under $300/month lease (0 down), but not sure it's feasible. Mostly I'm looking to get the most bang for my buck. I am eligible to get the GM Family discount (Chevy, GMC) so that could greatly impact my decision. Was looking at 2018 models since I figured I could get a better deal since they might be trying to get rid of them. Anyway. Here is my current list of possibilities. Sorry it's so long. Any input is appreciated.2018 Chevy Equinox2018 GMC Acadia2018 Honda CRV2018 Toyota Rav42018 Mazda CX-52018 Subaru Forrester2018 Cadillac XT52018 Lincoln MKC2018 Nissan Rogue2018 Infiniti QX60Thanks so much.

the Equinox is almost guaranteed to be the best bang for the buck. Some really good deals on those now. Especially if you have the GM program. The Rogue might be doable too. RAV4 has some deals since they are about to come out with a new design. Unlikely that the rest of them will be budget friendly. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Looking for a car for my ""soon to turn 16"" daughter. For next 9-12 months, may be driven mostly her Mom-. Fuel efficiency and safety are important (300 miles per week due to her school and extra curricular driving alone) . Was looking at hybrids (Ioniq/Insight/Prius) but somebody told me (Civic/Elantra/Mazda 3 ) may be better choice as hybrids may not save that much money and technology may change. But am still bewildered by number of choices of trims in thyese three as well as whether it makes sense to buy a used one (if new fangled safety features like autobraking, pedestrian radar detection, rear view mirror, blind spot monitoring are already present) or a new one. Basically how many model years can I go back to get these kind of features. Last issue is buy v/s lease. Not sure if lease for new driver makes sense in case there are small hits oir bumps which may result in extra penalties by dealer. Too many questions I know- but will be helpful if sbdy can answer from perspective of ""what is best for new teenager driver from safety /fuel efficiency viewpoint) ",Posts: 16,Member

a Prius would be fine. You should not have to worry about it becoming outdated. It will still work fine. And fits the key criteria for a teen driver. Economical, safe, and not too fast. The other options you mentioned are also fine choices, fitting the same criteria. I would recommend a couple of year old used one, particularly because of the miles you potentially are putting on it. and as you noted, any of the bumps and dings teens (especially parking in a school parking lot) are likely to pick up. If you stick to say 2 years old, you should be easily able to have it carry her right through college too. An Elantra is a really good choice for that, since they depreciate a bit more than a Civic or mazda. And are good reliable cars. Can also consider a Cruze if you don't mind domestic. trim level, at least go mid level to get some more desirable features, and look for safety items. An Elantra SE, can often come with the blind spot and back up camera even at a lower price. Other stuff (moonroof, etc.) is more of a frill. might be better to let your wife pick since she needs to drive it for a year.so, if I was picking, I would look for a 2017 Elantra SE with BLIS option on it. Should have around 20,000 miles or so. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Agree on the late model used car for best value. A used Prius or Elantra would be my top choices. My wife drives an Elantra (2012) and it's pretty nice. Seats & ride are good for long trips and she gets 36-40 highway depending on conditions & speed.As to buy v. lease, if driving 300+ miles/week leasing would not be to your advantage unless you got a great deal on a lease with a higher-than-average mileage allotment.

Thanks all for prompt responses - I will look at Elantra and Prius. I recently joined forums- But is there a good resource for how to negotiate lease terms. Also may be a dumb question- but does leasing happen only for new cars or even a used car can be leased? Lastly on Prius- hasn't Toyota run out of 200,000 cars limit that was placed for applicability of Federal tax savings.

Most leases include 10-12K miles/per year. As you've said 300 miles/week in known commute you'll burn through 12K miles in 40 weeks. That's not a full year and also doesn't include any incidental driving for errands, etc. So you'd be deep into a mileage penalty ($$) when the lease ended. Check the lease terms carefully.Your best value will be a 2-4 year old used car, possibly one that was a lease-return. If you buy the used car from a dealer of the same brand (used Prius from a Toyota dealer, for example) see about getting a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO). CPO cars will cost a little more but have better warranty than regular used cars (which usually only have the remainder of the original factory warranty left). That may provide some peace of mind WRT unanticipated repair costs. ","Posts: 1,459",Member

I'm looking to buy a used 2016 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Limited from a Subaru dealership. This car also comes with Eyesight and has navigation. According to CarFax, the car has a clean title - no damage or accident reported. Only one previous owner. It's priced at $12,900. The car has 103,000 miles on it - that's a lot for a car that's only 2 years old. But cccording to the dealer, the owner was working in sales, so he was driving from state to state within the region. The current old transmission is making a clicking sound, so the Subaru dealership is putting in a brand new transmission that will come with a 12-month warranty. Do you guys think that this is a good buy? I'm not very knowledgeable about cars, so I've done some fair bit of research, but could use some input. I'm in a social work program for graduate school, that's my primary reason for getting a car; I'll be needing it for my internship. I might sell the car off in 2 or 3 years, so resale value of the car is important to me. According to the dealer who I was working with, I could sell the car for no less than $10,000 as long as I do not hit 180,000 miles. She said that if the hit 180,000 miles, the resale value of the car would be maybe $7,000 or so. Is this information accurate?Does this seem like a good buy? Or should I keep looking around. Thank you. ",Posts: 10,Member

well, the resale at the various miles is a total guess. the price is a lot lower than comparable car with normal miles. and a brand new transmission is a big plus. hard to really peg the value on an outlier though.I would buy it for me, but that is because I don't put a lot of miles on per year. So that would be my question. What do you need to use it for? If local stuff and not many miles, it can make sense. If you are going to put 25,000/year on it too, I would say no. As long as it was maintained (regular oil changes), it should have many good years left. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

I think she's going way high on the resale values. After a car is past 100k the resale value starts to fall pretty fast. But almost all cars in general fall in value at a good clip. You are going to lose a lot of money owning whatever car you own because they depreciate. Cars that don't depreciate as fast would be something like a Honda CR-V, Civic, or Accord with lower miles.If you want a guaranteed resale value for your car after 3 years, you might consider leasing. Here's the official offer from Subaru usa on a brand new 2019 Forester wagon....""Lease a new 2019 Forester for $265/MonthOffer Details Now through October 31, 2018 Lease a new 2019 Forester for $265/Month on a 36-Month Lease (Standard Forester model, code KFB-01). $1,765 due at lease signing. $0 security deposit.

If I look at a 2014 with 118k miles, I see that trade-in value would be $7k. $10k would be more like a private party sale number.Question is: why this car? For example, you could get something like a 2015 Elantra Limited with half the miles for $1000 less. Again, looking at a 2-yr older model with 15k more miles, it would lose the same $3k as the subaru.

in terms of depreciation, the dealer is saying (not guaranteeing) that car will only depreciate $1,000/year over 3 years. That is nearly impossible. And it does not include maintenance (but, with all the big work done, you have a pretty good chance of it not needing much, if you don't put a lot of miles on it.for example, the Forester lease above, that is roughly $11,000 over 3 years. Compared to buying a car for $13,000, you only have to sell it for more than $2,000 to be ahead! The wild card of course, is with any used car, it could potentially give you trouble. But may not.A Subaru at least is a more substantial car than a prior generation Elantra or some similar used car. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Keep in mind even though the car is only 2 years old it has the mileage of a 5-6 year old car. So other parts are also wearing out such as suspension/steering compenents, driveline components, etc.. Honestly to most people (especially to us dealers) a car with 180k miles isn't worth a whole lot as it's nearing the end of its life span because of the mileage, where major repairs might be pricier than the value of the car itself. Many potential buyers might skip yours for a different make/model with lower miles and maybe less features for the same price ($10k) than for a high mileage loaded car.However if you do buy it and put very little mileage on it, the average mileage will balance out for the age of the vehicle. Let's say you keep it for 4 years and only put 20k miles on it, then you'd be selling a 120k mile 6 year old car which is a bit closer to average miles driven for a car (20k/year) then it is now. If you will put very little mileage on it and keep it for another 3-4 years it might not be a bad deal assuming everything checks out on it. If you'll keep it only a couple years and put a lot of miles on it, you might have trouble selling it for anywhere close to $10k.Like someone else asked, is there a specific reason you want this particular car instead of something lower mileage in the same price range?

I like that this the Subaru Legacy has the Eyesight feature. Having leather seats is important to me for hygiene purposes, too, because of the work that I do. Cars with less miles are going for $20,000 - it's more than what I hope to spend. The dealer said that there's a $2,000 warranty that I could purchase to cover anything under the hood. It's valid for 2 years. Whether I get a 30k mile car or a 100k mile car, I would still get this warranty. Edit: I'm doing a search. It seems like most Subaru Legacys with 30k miles are selling for at least $19,000 and those with over 60k miles are going for $16,000. 80k miles car depreciate to $15,000. The Subaru dealer said that they do not buy cars with 140k miles, but they have a wholesaler who would buy the car 2 to 3 years later even if it has 140k miles on it. She said they would be willing to buy it for $7,000 to $9,000 depending on the condition of the car and how well it has been taken care. Doesn't it all balance out to be about the same depreciation? If I get a 30k mile car at $19,000 now, I'd lose $3,000 to $4,000 2 to 3 years later if it's between 60k to 80k miles. Seems like my loss would be the same with the 100k mile car, too, if I'm thinking about it correctly.

My take: It sounds like the car hasn't been taken care of. Sounds like a lot of heartache, in store.What the dealership says about value in three years? You can blow your nose on that and throw it in the trash.A $2000 warranty on a car with over 100K miles? Good luck collecting on that.Read back over the comments from your fellow members.

A 30k mile car will cost you less in maintenance and potential repairs (warranty might only cover major specific components) over 2-3 years than a 100k mile car. So even though depreciation might be the same (assuming the dealer can somehow predict the future with a guaranteed trade in value 2-3 years down the road), you might still end up paying more out of pocket for cost of ownership.Like kyfdx said, a dealer hinting as to what a car is worth in 2-3 years is specualation and meaningless. I'm a dealer and would never quote a future value as there are so many factors that affect it:-mileage-cosmetic condition-accident history-maintenance and mechanical work needed-overall market and availability of similar modelsThese are factors that are impossible to predict months from now let alone years from now.

I hate it how leases are advertised like ""Just $179 a month!"" when there's a big up-front payment--in this case $1999. That makes the actual monthly payment closer to $235/month, not factoring in the time value of money. Some leases are a lot worse on the up-front payment, though. I don't like the idea of plunking down money up front on a lease. So I always get ""sign-and-drive"" leases, or at worst pay only the first payment up front. I agree with those who've said that there's better buys out there for $13,000 than a Subaru with 100k miles on it--even if it has a new transmission with a 12-month warranty. For example, I just did a search and found a 2013 Impreza Limited with 52k miles and a lifetime powertrain warranty at a local dealership for $14k. And a 2015 Forester Premium with 40k miles for $12.9k. There's others in this same price range with similar miles. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I decided against buying the Subaru Legacy. Took it to an independent car mechanic. Transmission fluid was leaking. Dealer did get it fixed up, but I didn't feel confident buying the car. I also did a longer test drive on it and didn't really like the feel of the car. The steering wheel felt too light and the brake pedal wasn't as sensitive as I'd like it to be. I've mostly driven my parents' European cars, not Japanese cars. What are some brands that drive like BMW, but is more reliable? I love the way BMW drives - the heavier steering. I don't mind that the service is more expensive than other brands. What I don't want to deal with is expensive repairs. lol ",Posts: 10,Member

not a good sign when a new transmission is leaking, but could just be a minor adjustment (loose clamp or some such). But, with any used car, if you are at all unsure, walk away. There are plenty more out there.Your European options are limited, especially on a lower budget. And running costs will be higher.From what you said, I think your best next step is to try out a couple of Mazdas. A 3 and a 6. Japanese, but easily the most ""Euro"" feeling of the choices, and more affordable to buy and maintain. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

If you don't want repairs, I suggest you buy or lease a new car. If I may ask, what big city are you located in or near? You might consider a 2019 Civic Sport, which has an msrp of c.$22k. If you can find a leftover 2018 Acura ILX, they currently have this lease deal....""$199 Per month for 36 months. $2,499 Total due at signing.""acura.comBut if you love BMWs, maybe consider trying for one of those?

I'm hoping to spend no more than $12,000 on a used car. I know that servicing for European cars are more expensive - I'm okay with this. I just don't want to deal with expensive repairs. Bimmers, for example, while I love how it drives, tend to require frequent repairs. Lots of Craigslist BMW owners saying that they invested $x,xxx on the car. Some are lucky, though, and didn't need any repairs aside from normal maintenance like oil change. I don't qualify for leasing cars because I don't have a credit score. Dealers wouldn't even allow me to lease a car if I can pay in full upfront. Another reservation I have with Japanese cars is that the interior feels ""hollow."" lol. Anyway, I was thinking of getting a car that has sports mode with simply allow me to have that heavy steering feel. I'm not so worried about features like navigation or backup camera. Those can be easily installed. And I have a Garmin. lol ",Posts: 10,Member

you aren't getting a 12K Euro sporty car that isn't likely to need money allocated for repairs. But, if you are careful in shopping you might pull it off.Try the Mazda. You might be surprised as to how sporty it drives. Maybe try an Infiniti. It you want a ""heavier"" driving experience, this could work.http://www.royaleasing.com/detail-2011-infiniti-g37_sedan-4dr_x_awd-used-18146697.htmlthis is probably something you would be looking at in your price range.

If by any chance you can stretch your budget, some VW dealers are selling new 2019 Jettas for c. $14k. This would give you a car with a 6 year 72,000 mile warranty and obviously no worries about repairs for that time. https://www.alexandriavw.com/inventory/new-2019-volkswagen-jetta-1-4t-s-fwd-4d-sedan-3vwn57bu1km098985A Jetta is less exciting to drive than a GTI, but if costs are a big concern....with a new Jetta your insurance costs will be lower, your gas mileage will be higher, and because VW has the longest bumper-to-bumper new car warranty your repair costs will be non-existent. Most used cars for c.$12k will have substantial repair and maintenance costs over the next 5 years. A new set of good tires that will likely be needed in the next couple of years for many used GTIs, for instance, will probably cost about $1000. Obviously you are unlikely to need new tires for the next 5 years with a new car, and mostly what you'll be having done will be oil changes. Overall I think you will save money with a new Jetta over getting a used $12k GTI. Just my 2 cents. Again, I realize it's less exciting to drive—but perhaps good enough. Finally, a new Jetta has Apple Carplay/AndroidAuto as standard, something not available on any car built more than about 3 years ago. Unless you are a technophobe, you probably want CarPlay/AA for navigation etc.http://www.vw.com/ ","Posts: 5,952",Member

plenty of options.

You can get really good deals on them. safe and reliable. a Nissan Altima can be a good option. Subaru Legacy is a great car and safe, but can be a little pricier. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Trying to find the best fit for me. Had the sienna minivan when kids were young then moved on to a BMW X3. Loved the luxury options but found myself missing the automatic doors and all the room of an enclosed truck (when I took the seats out)My first priority is sliding doors because I have 2 large dogs and they don’t want to get into the car unless they are sure I’m in it. Second priority is lots of cargo space. I don’t plan to normally have more than 2-3 seats. Third is safe driving in snow - we have a steep driveway. Fourth - I want a quiet ride (aside from the dogs barking) And I’d like all the bells and whistles for the driver - no need for the cabin. Any suggestions for the best choices for my unconventional needs? Is there anything out there other than a minivan?  ",Posts: 1,Member

It depends what you plan to use it for.I'm not familiar with the Monteros but I believe they would be heavy on gas compared to the rest in this group.The Suzuki XL7 came in two generations. The first ones are fairly simple mechanically, but small if you plan on using all 7 seats. These were basically an extended version of the Suzuki Grand Vitara, which was a compact SUV. They should be pretty decent for light off roading. The newer XL7's came out around 2006/2007 and are a bit roomier but I don't believe they would have as good off road capability as the first generation.The Honda Pilots have the most car like ride out of the group, and a good combination of space and comfort. They are all 8 seaters. However the Pilots of that era (along with Acura MDX's) had some transmission issues so be aware of that. Volvo XC90's in my opinion will cost the most to run and most to repair. They have less room than the Pilot and the rear seats are cramped. Many XC90's that I've come across that are priced low have existing issues that the previous (2nd and 3rd) owners didn't want to deal with due to high costs and therefore are looking to offload them now. Controls inside are ""different"" than most other SUVs and very quirky which may be hard to get used to.Explorers and Trailblazers can be bought relatively cheap and although they might not be as refined as a Pilot, parts should be readily available at reasonable costs. Explorers might be heavier on gas though than the Pilots.Hope that helps. ","Posts: 5,528",Member

November 2018 ",fushigi,"
I agree with boomchek. I'd add that Suzuki & Isuzu have left the US market so parts availability might be more of an issue over time. Generally speaking, in order I'd go for the Pilot, Explorer, Montero Sport, and then any of the others. This is assuming you're mostly after an AWD SUV but do relatively little offroading. If you do offroad I'd say Explorer, Montero Sport, Suzuki, then the rest.I owned a V6 Mitsu Galant (should be substantially the same V6 as the Montero Sport) for over 10 years and had no major issues with reliability.

Just based on your list, an Explorer with the 4.6 v8 is going to likely be the most reliable and cheapest to maintain; however, likely the worst one of the list to spend time in. My personal choice would be an XC90 FWD 2.5T. The only common issue with that configuration is the wheel bearings, and that is obviously not a big deal. And, speaking as someone who went from a Pilot to an XC90, it is the nicest vehicle on your list. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I appreciate guys. Excellent input..so far...Just to clarify off road is really not something I'm planning on doing so not as important, but snow is something I would have to deal with. Also gas consumption it is a concern of course does play a role. The reason I want to get an SUV is more based on room but I don't like minivans with the exception of the Pacifica which is kind of an SUV and minivan at the same time (cheaper too) but I don't trust them at all out of things I have read. Based on y'all recommendations I feel a little more comfortable with the Suzuki & the Montero and a bit disappointed at the Pilot if they do in fact have possible transmission problems. Boom the 7 passenger is not really a biggie plus like you said the newer ones (if I find one) are roomier. I really like the style of that little truck. (Suzuki). I do understand they are not in the US market but willing to gambleAlso the Suzuki and the Montero quoted much lower rates for insurance compared to the Trailblazer (the most expensive) and Explorer. Not sure why is that. Anyone know anything about the Isuzu Axiom? Love the Volvo but my concern with the XC90 is maintainance costs. Fushigi I also owned a Galant with mix results. Thank you guys ",Posts: 10,Member

Hi everyone,I've been browsing the forums for a few months now and am finally looking to lease my first car in the next month or so. I like compact SUVs and can afford a monthly payment in the 400-430 range. Location is Los Angeles, CA.Safety is the biggest need, hoping for emergency braking and rear-view camera features. Possibly more if still in the affordability range. I am still a new driver even in my mid-20s Not sure if this is helpful information, the only car I've driven consistently is a 2010 Lexus RX 350 and I feel very comfortable in it (almost a bit too big for me though). I think this might be out of my price range though.Any advice greatly appreciated into what make/model might be best for me! And of course any other advice!

The lease is up on my 2016 Forte5 soon so I started looking for a replacement several weeks ago. I checked out leases on the likes of an Elantra, Forte, Mazda3, Impreza but could find nothing close to the $185/mo. sign-and-drive I got on the Forte5. About the closest I could get is around $215/month for a Forte LXS or Elantra SE. So I decided to go the used route this time. I only need a car for another 3-4 years, and then I'll get a nicer, long-term car for retirement. My goal was to try to stay under $8000, under 70,000 miles, and I had to have Bluetooth. My preference was to buy from a reputable dealer vs. private party. And I wanted a clean title. Wanted a small car--fuel economy and easy to park. Not a lot available in that ballpark; mostly Foci, Fiestas, Sparks, Mirages, Sonics, Versas and Versa Notes, most with more than 70k miles. Also I decided to steer clear of the Focus and Fiesta due to their poor history of reliability. Mirage and Spark are too small; Sonic was OK (my sister has one) but not many out there. Versa Note SV would be ok but again not many out there. And the cars under $8k tend to be black, my least favorite color. Then I saw an ad for a 2011 Forte EX hatchback at the dealer I leased my Forte5 from. Even though it was black, I decided to take it for a drive. Nice little car, had a moonroof and alloys, was a one-owner with all maintenance done at the dealer and was in great condition. 69k miles. But black. So I passed. A few days later I saw they took the price down to $6,995, and I was tempted. But then I saw another 2011 Forte EX with 67k miles, and it was titanium in color, and loaded--every option I think except leather. Had moonroof, nav, and the Tech package with keyless ignition, auto climate control, fog lamps, and several other goodies. Another one owner, clean CarFax with all maintenance done, also recent new brakes and battery. So I took it for a drive, liked it, haggled a bit, and agreed on $7,315. It had just come in and they had to get it spruced up, so I told them I'd come and get it in a couple of weeks when I returned from a trip. Arranged for 5-year financing with my bank @ 3.35%, and picked up the car last Monday. One of the fog lamps was out, so they replaced that, I signed the papers and drove it home. It has a one-month bumper-to-bumper warranty and two-month powertrain warranty. Also this dealership group gives you a card worth 10 cents off a gallon and $6 ""ultimate"" washes, for 3 years. I've been driving it all week and really like it. Not quite as solid as my 2016, but it feels more nimble and I'm learning to appreciate the keyless start, which I've never had in anything other than a rental. I know I'll appreciate the moonroof come spring. And I really appreciate my payment being $40 less each month. Just hope the car holds up for about 3 years and 30k miles. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

(Yeah, I'm late. Sue me!)What I would have done was to visit the local new car shows to assist with narrowing the range of CUVs that you might have been interested in. I visited the DC show a number of years ago to help me figure out what I wanted. I would have recommended Mazda's products (CX-3, CX-5) because of (this can't be emphasized enough) the driving dynamics infused into the vehicles. I own a Mazda 5, and every quick lane change I make is a little fun. The maneuvers go precisely as you expect, and there's no wobble that has to be compensated against. There are very few vehicles that can do that and not cost as much as a luxury vehicle.Other than that, I'm hoping that you've found a vehicle that allows you to see as much traffic around you (many vehicles have thick pillars and smaller windows that work against outside visibility), have large rear view mirrors, and (especially if the vehicle is cursed with visibility issues) have sensors and/or cameras that can help you figure out what's around your car while driving.

Hello! I am hoping you all can help me make a decision or at least narrow down my choices to 3 or so to test drive. We are looking to lease and need our payments to be around $450/month or so. Because lease rates vary so much and seem to be better for luxury brands, I can't go based solely on price alone. We are a family of 4 and this is our only car (we both work from home). We may be breaking down and getting a sedan as a second soon, but for now, this is the only car for the family. The important things we want are 3 rows of seats and captain's chairs in the second row. We don't care if the third row is 2 or 3 seats. While that likely means a fairly large vehicle, I prefer it to feel smaller when driving and have decent pickup. In the past we have leased a Toyota Highlander, which we liked fairly well (it felt a bit like driving a bus though with it's narrow body and long length, and was not very ""fun"" to drive) and now are almost done with our lease of a GMC Acadia, which we do not like at all and cannot wait to get rid of. At first I liked the Acadia for it's pickup and good handling, but we have been in and out of the dealer for various reasons with things going wrong (one of the main reasons we lease is to avoid this!) and the car lurches when it changes gears. Below are all the various SUVs we are considering, which I realize is a lot, so I am hoping you will be able to help me narrow it down a bit. It's also possible that I'm missing a good option. Again, so much depends on the lease rate, so I plan to go to that forum and look them all up next, but thinking we'll need to keep the total price below $50k so matter how awesome the rate is. Oh, and although we don't need all the bells and whistles available, we do like to have some, so usually end up going with the second highest trim level to get most but not all. And I realize this is silly, but if possible, I prefer not to have the same car every other soccer mom drives and am not a fan on Hondas. And thank you very much in advance!!Kia Telluride - love the fact that it's brand new so not a ton of people will have it, but the lease rate is not great, and I really like the look of it even though it's largeVW Atlas - also like this one as it's newer and has a good look to itSubaru Ascent - this is another newer car, so I like that about it, but I really don't know much about Subarus at all as I haven't generally liked their look in the past, but this one is done pretty wellLand Rover Discovery Sport - I didn't know there was a Land Rover in my price range, but this be appears to be and has a great look to it. I don't know anything else about the brand thoughHyundai Santa fe XL - had a Tucson years ago and liked it well enough, but this one is very generic and common, so not super exciting to me, but would consider if it has the best set of features for a good priceFord Explorer - now that it offers second row captain's chairs it's made the list, but am not loving the fact that the body style hasn't changed for so many yearsDodge Durango Buick Enclave Chevrolet Traverse ",Posts: 35,Member

Ascent is great car. But so far, not leasing great. Ditto with the Mazda CX-9. Those are my favorites. The Santa Fe XL is also nice and well regarded. Plus all 3 are less Bargey than the really big boats.A highlander XLE is probably the beast lease deal right now.Explorer is a barge and long in the tooth, but a brand new design is coming out so maybe deals to be had?Land Rover will cost you. Durango is definitely more trucky but could be a decent deal.Maybe an Infiniti QX60. Some screaming deals on those right now.My list would be infinit, Mazda, Subaru and the Santa Fe.

I remember really liking the Mazda CX-9 early in my research, but I don't think it has an option for captain's chairs in the 2nd row, nor does the Infiniti I don't think.

I've got a spreadsheet and am tracking all of them and it's amazing how different the money factors can be, which seems to make a huge difference!Question for stickguy... why do you say the Land Rover will cost us? From what I can tell, the money rate is fantastic and the MSRP seems reasonable for the Sport. Is there another factor I may be missing and not considering? Again, thank you for your help!!

I think you need to test drive them, to see what you like. Making your decisions on the relative strength of the lease deal - based on all the numbers you've requested - is the wrong approach. You may find a great lease deal on a car you hate to drive. I've seen it happen time and time again on these forums. ","Posts: 199,247",Moderator

Thanks Micheall, you are probably right. I'm just trying to narrow down the choices, as I'm a full time working mom of 2 and just don't have many opportunities to go test drive cars, and don't want to fall in love with something we can't afford either :-) Thank you for all your help today.

ShilohJ said:I remember really liking the Mazda CX-9 early in my research, but I don't think it has an option for captain's chairs in the 2nd row, nor does the Infiniti I don't think. My kids like the idea of those, but it's the adults who will be driving, so I might veto that request if needed, lol. Thank you for the feedback! I've got a spreadsheet and am tracking all of them and it's amazing how different the money factors can be, which seems to make a huge difference!Question for stickguy... why do you say the Land Rover will cost us? From what I can tell, the money rate is fantastic and the MSRP seems reasonable for the Sport. Is there another factor I may be missing and not considering? Again, thank you for your help!! It's so hard to narrow these choices down :-)
He might be referring to the ""cost"" of time and aggravation with Land Rover, but I'm not sure--he might just be referring to MSRP.The 2018 U.S. Initial Quality Study shown here is based on responses from 75,712 purchasers and lessees of new 2018 model-year vehicles who were surveyed after 90 days of ownership. So, 2019 models could be better (or worse).  ","Posts: 64,482",Member

LR is a more intense ownership experience. which does not sound like something you want. Plus last I checked lease prices were not good.I would have to check on the captains chairs.

That's initial quality.  Look at the long term ratings, as they are MUCH more meaningful.Long term has its own problems, though. What if, on Car X, the initial quality was horrible? So the poor owner brings it in for 8 warranty claims and now, one year later, the car is pretty squared away. Is that ""higher score"" really that reassuring for what might happen in Year Two?

12-13 year old vehicles can have problems, that's for sure. Spend $100 or so to have a trusted mechanic conduct a 'pre purchase inspection' (PPI) to identify any obvious problems. It's be nice to have their maintenance history, but that can be hard to come by. Also, pull a CarFax on whichever you're most interested in.

I was earlier set on buying 2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL 4MOTION for $41,500 but looking at MDX deal its very tempting. VW Atlas is a clear winner for us since we have kids in car seats so we can't put them in 3rd row. Hence we would need 3rd two that's good for adults when family members visit us for extended period of time - about couple of months once or twice a week as well as few weekends from Friday to Monday when we go road tripping.Also other VW Atlas features such as digital cockpit, spacious cargo when 3rd row seats are folded, sunroof/moonroof extending over 2nd row are really valuable vs. Acura MDX. Only reason Acura MDX is still on our mind is because of nicer looking cabin with leather seats, don't like cabin and leatherette seating surfaces in VW Atlas. ",Posts: 16,Member

A bit more elaborate / specific question.I want to switch up the stable with a new baby here (still in NICU  ) and the desire to get momma into an SUV and stop daily driving vehicles that need up-rated gasoline (>87 octane).Current stable:2000 Corvette - Selling, plan on $12,000 from sale2013 Ram 1500 - Selling, plan on $17,000 from sale2006 BMW 330i - Keeping, could only make $2,000 from sale (221,500 miles)The idea is to sell the vette, use the money to mostly pay for new SUV for wife, sell truck, pay off SUV, remainder becomes my new daily.SUV requirements are 2-row, AWD, 87 octane, like to be in the 20's for mpg. She is eyeing a Cadillac SRX.My daily gets tricky. I want to have another truck due to the utility aspect. I also want to be able to tow 6,000 lbs (u-haul auto transport + car). My idea was a 2013 regular cab V6 Ram short bed (8' looks horrid proportionally). I would prefer better mpg but it's not a total deal-breaker. My commute is 64 miles / day.Plan on keeping the BMW as a fun thing just due to age, mileage, and the fact I won't get much $ at all for it. Like having 3 cars for the backup. Have to sell in the order is listed earlier cause wife can't drive stick and both vette and BMW are manual. Want to have 2 cars she can drive in case one goes down.Fun side note: Oklahoma roads be rough my friend...Anyway that's my thought.

it is also quite pricey like that. Pushing 40K.based on the $ amounts (and mention of an SRX) must be looking used. So, will largely depend on what she likes, and what you can find that is clean. My take, an SRX is probably not a good bet in that price range.How about a Hyundai santa fe? The just replaced generation (new for 2013) is very nice, good value, respectable MPG. and could still be under warranty. Ford Edge could be a good option too.for the truck, unless you are getting something much older are way higher miles, are you really going to save that much making that move? Might be better to just keep what you have it if works, in good shape, etc. Plus, I assume you have a V8? I would not want to be using the the V6 model to tow that much weight on an open trailer.

If the total outlay over the lease is the same, much better idea to save money up front and do a higher payment. If something happens and the car gets totaled early on, that money you put down just disappears. Better off hanging onto it and doling it out each month. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Hello! Just looking for any additional thoughts. My daughter's car recently died, so I'm in the market so I can give her my accord.

Just so I understand this correctly, How do you find out about MF and RV numbers for used cars (ex. 2016-2018)? Or are those numbers only for new cars? ",Posts: 8,Member

What kind of lease payment are you looking for? An X3, for example, leases fairly well (probably better than an Explorer) and gets darned good mileage. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

themesofd said:Hello All! I will be LEASING a NEW vehicle in July and need some advice on on some car options. Price range: between 300-400/month for a 36 months / 10k mile lease. What is important to me is that it is FUN to drive, while being a practical daily driver. Must haves: fun acceleration, nice interior without the cheap hard plastic, manual transmission, and in the small to small/medium sized category. I have been looking at the Mazda3 hatchback (a little too small and underpowered for my liking), Civic Si (nice overall but lots of plastic and not a fan of the exterior), and the VW GTI SE (my favorite so far, but not a huge fan of the depreciation compared to the civic). Any other options or thoughts? Thanks!
There's a good lease deal right now on the G70 2.0T and that can be had with a stick. I think the deal is $299/month for 36 months, with some money up front but it should be under $400/month even with that. Maybe they'll have a good lease deal in July also. ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Hello everyone! As the title might explain i am looking for some help to choose which used car which be the best for me and for the money, i do not know especially much about cars so that is why i am reaching out for help from you guys.The cars considered is : Porsche cayenne 2012 ( around 90 k's usage ), Porsche Panamera 4 2010 ( around 80 k's of usage ) Audi SQ5 2014 ( around 70 k*s of usage ).I definitely looking for a car which has comfort, as me and the family of 3 do a lot of driving vacations, but at the same time i would like a "" boys dream "" and everyday car as well that can hit the gas and eat that corner when i want it too.What i am really looking to answers about if is anyone have any experience with any of these vechicles personally? Any flaws from fabric i should be aware about or any other things to consider? and the driving experince of course.I know the Audi is a lot newer than the panemera etc, but since the panemera did not change until 2013 and still has this amazing look inside, it just doesnt looks old in my opinion. But at the same time the Audi do has more in build features and the panoramic roof which i love,, also cheaper to maintain from what i can read. Also i kind of got into these compact suv stuff that is going on and just love the way you sit in a suv. Which the panemera of course do not offer. As mentioned i did also consider the Cayenne as is kind of has both, but i am not sure if the size gets too big for 3 people and city driving.For info this is the first ""expensive car"" i ever bought, so really hope you can help a fella here on he's way to the right purchase.Happy day everyone.

Hi, so I'm trying to buy a used car in the 6,000 to 7,500 dollar price range, and they're quite hard to come by in my area. I'm not picky about brand, I simply need something reliable and if possible, fun to drive. My first choice would be a Civic, but they're nearly impossible to find here. So I'm looking at these two specific cars right now. Carfaxes available for both in the links.https://www.mcnairautosales.com/inventory/chevrolet/malibu/c159171/https://www.pruittford.com/used-Burkburnett-2012-Volkswagen-Jetta-25L+SE+Convenience++Sunroof-3VWBP7AJ1CM317319I would be leaning towards the Jetta because it has way lower miles, but there are a few things giving me pause. First, they said it has a check engine light on and that ""the guy who traded it to them took it to a shop and had them hook it to the computer and they said it was a map sensor which would cost 85 dollars to fix."" That doesn't exactly scare me, because I know it could be that, or something else easy, but I know it could be bs and who knows. I've also read that they tend to have some problems with their lights constantly burning out every so often. Of course, the Malibus have some problems too, but they do seem to be really reliable from what I can see. They did send me pictures of the Jetta, everything looks in good condition. I think the car was sitting on the lot untouched for a week, and when I asked for pics they detailed it and sent me pics. The first set had no pics of the engine, but the car is spotless. I asked for pics of the engine too and it's covered in dirt. They are offering to pick me up and take me back home if I don't buy the car, and obviously I'll be taking the car to get inspected. But I don't want to waste my time.So could someone point me in a direction? How do you compare two cars like this? Is the Jetta worth going to look at? It's probably the lowest mileage car I've found in my price point. Also, I have 200 dollars off the Jetta from their online promotion. ",Posts: 3,Member

my rule of thumb with cars in this age/price range is buy condition and history more than specific brand (as long as it is something acceptably reliable). You are correct though that this is a tough price point, and can take some looking.anyway, for the 2 options, the Jetta is listed at a manual transmission. Assuming that is correct, is that something you want? And the miles difference in this case is not that big. The Malibu is likely going to be cheaper to maintain, though that model Jetta is pretty bulletproof too, and reasonable simple. They can have some electric gremlins at times, but I am not aware of a big problem with lights burning out, but bulbs are cheap.the red flag is the CEL. That would nix it for me. If it really was a cheap and easy fix, they would have done it, and raised the price more than it cost them to do it. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Need some help so I don't make the same mistake I made in 2015, I overpaid for a new car and am finally not upside down on my car loan. I currently drive a Honda Civic coupe EX, manual and I use to love it, until I moved to Colorado and had a baby. I couldn't drive my car for 2 months last winter and now that it is summer, climbing into my back seat to put my son in his car seat is very difficult. Also, it only has air vents in the front so that back gets very hot. We are also planning on having another child in the next year or so.Looking for a 3 row SUV, we live in Western Colorado (3 hours from Albuquerque, 6 hours from Denver) so we do a lot of road trips and like to bring Grandparents along for help. Would love leather seats because kids are messy, and heated seats would really help me not fight with my husband since he likes it cold and I like to be warm. We also have 2 big dogs, 80lb German Shepherd & 120lb Newfoundland, that would occasionally join us. AWD is a must, we get a lot of snow and live at the base of a ski mountain. My payment now for my car is $424 and I would love to not go too much higher than that if possible. Open to leasing a used car if that is something dealerships do.Here is what I was thinking:2019 Subaru Ascent - I think the Limited comes with everything I want and has the lowest price I've found so far. Open to the 2020 but I assume that would cost more.Ford Explorer - Love this suv but I think I have to go up in trim to get what I wantKia Telluride - I was seriously considering this even though I'm not a fan of Kia until I saw people were paying over msrpHyundai Palisade - Same as Kia ",Posts: 13,Member

you can't lease a used car, but might work on a new one, though the options you are looking at can get pricey even on a lease. Depends a lot on how many miles you put on. and good news, Hondas hold value, and stick EX Civic coupes have a following.yes, at this point, a 2019 should be cheaper. Leasing, definitely the way to go. If buying, can make sense if you are planning to keep a long time.A Sube in Colorado is a natural, though can't say if that will help your price hopes. Plus, since you are in the mountains, a car with a Turbo engine is a good option (they don't lose power at elevation like a non-Turbo does). The Ascent has gotten rave reviews. The explorer is really outdated, and a brand new design just came out. Could likely get a good deal on the old style though if you like it.Telluride rated highly, but might be a little wheezy at altitude.Consider a Honda Pilot too, since you like your Civic. Plus they seem to have good deals right now.Also, I highly recommend figuring out what you really like (what works for you, room, driveability) so that you enjoy it and will keep it. A good deal is great when you sign the papers, but if you hate the car and want out before long, false economy! ","Posts: 44,762",Member

I definitely need to go and test drive before making a decision, I'd like to narrow it down to 2 (max 3) since dealers are exhausting when you go. My Civic has 28k miles on it and that is after making 2 trips back and forth from CA to CO, I really don't put many miles on my car. I think I'll have to make a trip to sell my car since it doesn't really work in our area, I was thinking of visiting a CarMax in Albuquerque, bigger city/ easier weather.I'm not well versed in engines, I'll do my research on Turbo/non-Turbo, but great to know since we are high elevation. I was looking into the Honda Pilot, but when I compared prices the AWD Pilot was more than the mid trim level Ascent. Maybe I should keep an eye out for any deals/ rebates. When I looked into the 2019 Explorer, I didn't really like it, seemed to be on the same tech level as my 2015 Civic and I was looking for an upgrade. ",Posts: 13,Member

I'm confused as to why you think the Civic doesn't work in your area. I'd suggest you go right ahead and list it for sale yourself. Use ebay or autotrader or any of the other number of choices to get a larger audience. With such low miles and a stick shift, you'll attract multiple buyers, I'm sure.The outgoing MDX is leasing quite well right now, but I'm not sure it is big enough for everything you have listed.

vikkirules said:Need some help so I don't make the same mistake I made in 2015, I overpaid for a new car and am finally not upside down on my car loan. I currently drive a Honda Civic coupe EX, manual and I use to love it, until I moved to Colorado and had a baby. I couldn't drive my car for 2 months last winter and now that it is summer, climbing into my back seat to put my son in his car seat is very difficult. Also, it only has air vents in the front so that back gets very hot. We are also planning on having another child in the next year or so.Looking for a 3 row SUV, we live in Western Colorado (3 hours from Albuquerque, 6 hours from Denver) so we do a lot of road trips and like to bring Grandparents along for help. Would love leather seats because kids are messy, and heated seats would really help me not fight with my husband since he likes it cold and I like to be warm. We also have 2 big dogs, 80lb German Shepherd & 120lb Newfoundland, that would occasionally join us. AWD is a must, we get a lot of snow and live at the base of a ski mountain. My payment now for my car is $424 and I would love to not go too much higher than that if possible. Open to leasing a used car if that is something dealerships do.Here is what I was thinking:2019 Subaru Ascent - I think the Limited comes with everything I want and has the lowest price I've found so far. Open to the 2020 but I assume that would cost more.Ford Explorer - Love this suv but I think I have to go up in trim to get what I wantKia Telluride - I was seriously considering this even though I'm not a fan of Kia until I saw people were paying over msrpHyundai Palisade - Same as Kia
You might consider a VW Atlas as well. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Need your suggestions for selecting our next car. Just became empty nesters about a year back and thinking of getting a second car for us, now that one of our cars is really showing its age (used almost 20 years). Ease of getting in/out of the car and putting stuff in/out of the trunk is getting a little more important. Comfort is more important than acceleration, although it will be a nice to get a car which is not too 'dull'. Car will be used for commute plus pleasure. Based on SoCal and won't be driving to places with snow. We won't be hauling a lot of big stuff, so huge cargo space is not essential, but longer travel few times a year means it should not be too small. Safety and reliability are very important. Although we can definitely spend more, thinking of a base budget of $35k-40k (hopefully at the lower side of the range, but can stretch a bit if it is a good value). We can buy new or Certified Used low mileage cars. Based on all of this, we are thinking more along the line of a compact SUV or wagon or even a nice biggish hatch-back (do they even make them for US market?). Want to avoid CVTs mainly because of lower reliability. Cars that came to mind - Acura RDX, Lexus NX or possibly RX, upper trims of RAV4, etc. Any suggestions on which cars we should check out?

If you don't need a lot of cargo room, maybe you should consider a car instead of an SUV? A car will probably save thousands over an SUV, and cars often get higher mpg as well. I think the lease incentives on the Acura TLX are more more than $7000, meaning that if you can get an additional discount of $3k you can get as much as $10k off. Several of us here have Acura TLXs because of the luxury, performance, handling, features, quality, etc. If you don't need super fast acceleration the 4 cylinder probably has enough power for you, and I often get over 36 mpg on the highway in mine even with the AC on going c. 70 mph.

Thank you. Will check the new TLX models. My impression from few years back was that the ease of getting in/out and also access to trunk was still not as good as a small SUV. I do not have much of an issue with this, but my wife finds that sedans tend to have lower seats. Trunk set-up in sedans typically requires lifting above a rim while taking stuff in/out vs. just sliding in. The other consideration is that our other car is a sedan and having a different type of car offers some flexibility. ",Posts: 3,Member

I'm currently driving a Toyota Rav-4, and just am not a fan. I'm pretty tall, about 6'2"" and I just feel cramped in it. I drive a lot of miles to/from work so not looking for a gas hog. I need to get 2 car seats in it to pick the kids up from the sitter but my wife drives a mini-van so we use that on weekends, road trips, etc. so don't really need a 3rd row. I'm leaning towards a mid-size SUV or possibly hatchback. Not really concerned with trunk space. AWD would be nice but not a must have.My dad drives a Ford F150 where the center console flips up and can be another seat. I LOVE driving that thing because it's so roomy and comfortable. Now, I know it's a giant truck but I'm just wondering if there's anything out there that's more fuel efficient than a pickup but gets me closer to that kind of interior comfort.Looking to spend like 20/25K.

Hello! I've been researching on this site for a while but haven't posted before. My husband and I are looking to purchase a used vehicle at a max price of around $15,000. Our first step was to ""try on"" different vehicles that would be comfortable for either of us because our heights are very different (hubby is 6'3"" and I'm 5'5""). We don't want a huge vehicle so not interested in trucks or big SUVs. So far we've found a few makes/models that can work for us both (in no particular order):2014 Honda CRV (though admittedly, this one was technically above our price range)2016 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen2017 Jeep Renegade Sport2016 Toyota Camry2009 Subaru ForesterI know the Honda, Toyota and Subaru's are generally more reliable, but curious if there are any general thoughts about any of the ones I've listed. The years here are more incidental - they just happened to be ones we found to try on. I'd just like to narrow it down a bit more before looking for some good deals.We'll certainly have our mechanic look over anything we're considering, but even with that we really don't want any big repair surprises if we can help it. Yes, we have considered leasing, but want to drive more than most leases allow plus we'd like to hang onto the car for a while. Thanks for any thoughts. ",Posts: 4,Member

Forester has been redesigned a couple times since then, so bigger and nicer. so if you liked the old one, should like a newer model even more!wanting to keep it for a long time changes the equation a bit, since you are taking LT durability into account. But at the same time, makes depreciation a bit less of an issue, so easier to just buy what you like.I think you are also finding out that some cars just cost crazy money used. CRV (especially) and Forester among them. So for same $ will get older and/or higher mileage.I personally don't care for the little Jeeps that much, and make sure to really research reliability. But, lots of people love them. VWs as they age can also be a bit temperamental, but the sportwagon does drive nice.If you don't need a wagon style, usually a Sedan can be your best bang for the buck. Purchase price, better MPG, and nice to drive. Can't go wrong with a Camry like that for cheap, comfortable, reliable transportation. And if you are looking at the Camry, give the prior generation (up to I think 2017) Accord too. Great cars, very reliable. Camry and Accord probably cost a little more than some of the competitors (like a Fusion) but they are really good cars. Might also look at a Legacy. All the Subaru goodness (and AWD) but in a sedan style, and move better deals than a comparable Forester. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

I would cross off the Pilot and Murano, as both have higher than normal transmission failures. I personally don’t trust Mitsu. Which engine is in the JGC? I’d take a 5.7, no doubt.

my opinion is, when you are shopping in the well used and cheap aisle, condition and maintenance history is way more important than what the nameplate is. If anything made it 15 years and 150K miles, it must have been a good car. Only question is, how much life is left? IOW, but the best shape one.And unless you have a really specific need for AWD or a trucklet, stick with simpler cars. Less to go wrong.

I wouldn't bank on it. A big factor with these was HOW they were used.

yes, but I am referring to this problem in particular as well. The issue with these is that the 2nd gear was not getting sufficient lubrication. The fix implemented by Honda was to first inspect the trans with a scope, and those that showed wear were replaced, in those that did not, they were to drill a hole in the gearbox and install an aux oil jet over 2nd gear. They were finding (obviously) that those seeing heavier duty were more likely to need replacement. IIRC, they extended the warranty to 100k. Maybe it was 80k. This was a long time ago for our 2003 model. Ours was deemed OK and just got the jet installed. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

price range is high enough to get most anything, but as always, want something fancier, you get older and/or higher mileage.And might need to temper expectations on ""good gas mileage"". Not many 3 row SUVs really get good mileage.that being said, other good options are Hyundai Santa Fe (the 3 row V6 version). Won't have to go too far back for one of those, and can be under warranty. Kia Serento another possibility. Can also fit a Pilot into the budget, but will be older most likely.Explorer has 3 rows.I really like the Santa Fe.https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/795955447/overview/ ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Hi everybody a noob on this leasing calculations, trying to get a 3 row SUV on what would be my first lease. I'm wobbling between the 2020 Hyundai Palisade, 2020 KIA Telluride, 2019 Mazda CX-9 and the 2020 Subaru Ascent. We already test drove them, we liked them and after getting the January figures (MF, residual and incentives) from @Michaell and @kyfdx (thank you guys) I tried to do my best calculations and I can tell these are not vehicles where I can get a good deal from.Palisade and Telluride are impossible to get under MSRP due the low inventory, Subaru salespeople doesn't want to give good price and we are not sure yet about the cargo and 3rd row space on the CX-9.Is there any other 3-row SUV that leases well this month? I'm trying to get a good deal on a $35k-$38k car.Is it possible to get a monthly payment between $350 and $450, zero down, for a vehicle like that? ",Posts: 9,Member

CX9 is leasing OK this month.Your number will depend on the options. For example, a CX9 grand touring is going to be the very upper limit of your budget, while a Touring with Premium is nearly $50/mo less. A Honda Pilot EX-L? Yes. A Honda Pilot EX-L with Nav and RES? Less likely. And, of course, the number of miles you need will change the price, too. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Hi, I could use some help. I have been driving a minivan for the last 15 years. I used the lemon law to get rid of 17 Pacifica and then got an 18 Pacifica. No comments . Now my Pacifica has been in shop for 40 days and they can't figure out why the battery keeps dying and I keep getting engine failure light. So, I am going to have to lemon law the 18 also. I love the car and realize that the Odyssey or Sienna do not have the same features in the same price point. Maybe it is time I look at an SUV- but within my budget. I want to stay under $45k (high end). I have a fully loaded Pacifica so will I be able to find anything under $40k that has all those bells and whistles AND has room for 4 kids?

none of the SUVs short of a Suburban will have the combo of cargo room with the 3rd row up, or room in the back row for passengers. But, you should be able to get away with something like a Traverse or Enclave (the one that is still jumbo sized). Just check out the cargo space to see if it is big enough. Price wise you should be OK. there are other options in that size range. I think the Explorer is pretty big still in the back. Might be some option in the foreign brands. VW Atlas is pretty roomy. might have an issue on the sticker price, depending on if you can live with something that is not the total top end. If nothing else, go check one out for size and comfort.

Hi all,So I'm in the market to look for a new car that I will hopefully keep for a long time. I currently drive a 2017 Ford Escape which has been going strong for me for the last few years and I truly love the car. My issue is my current commute to work is about 110 miles a day, and my escape only gets about 27mpg. So I guess first question is would a Hybrid be a suitable option for the distance I drive? I see they get great mpg but my biggest fear is the reliability. The brands I'm looking into are Honda (Accord Hybrid), Hyundai (Sonata Hybrid), Ford (Escape Hybrid). I know Toyota has really ironed out all of their Hybrid systems, but I'm not a huge fan of the way their interior looks. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",Posts: 2,Member

Currently it is alot of Highway driving, but I have the option to take city streets which cuts me down to 74 miles a day. I would take this route more often, but it takes an extra 5 min to get work, and I've also seen no benefits in my gas mileage with my escape taking this route.

I have a lease ending on a 2018 Giulia Ti Sport Q4 which has been a total blast. It is a great driver's car, and handles turns extremely well. The 280 hp turbo has some fairly decent power in D mode. I have a loaded model with limited slip diff, adaptive suspension and dynamic cruise control. Seat side bolsters are very good and essential for hard cornering. One big surprise for me was the headlights which give exceptional lighting at night (bi-Xenon) and are steering responsive. By the way, no reliability problems! My dilemma now is what to replace it with.Key criteria are:* must be AWD* good drivers car (turn handling, fast acceleration)* prefer upscale interior and quiet road noise because I take phone calls in the car* more tech the better (adaptive cruise, HUD would be very cool but doubt I would pay for it)* Control knob is way better than touch screens (how can you possibly focus on the road while driving and trying to reach out in a moving car to touch the screen???)* must lease wellWhy not just get another Giulia? maybe, but it seems lease terms are not quite as stellar as when I got the 2018. I doubt I can match my same total cost (I will push for it...)There seem to be limited options for driver's cars that meet these criteria. For example,WRX - would be awesome to have an AWD performance stick (almost no AWD sticks anymore) but the interior is outdated and road noise is high, unfortunately it also does not look refinedAudis - generally lease poorly and there is no adaptive cruise until the pricey trim levelsBMW - maybe, but at least the variety in my price range - see them everywhere (3-series, etc. are not head turners), and it seems the trim packages you have to go way up to get decent tech. Maybe a base M240i and forego the fancier tech? probably pushing out of my budget...Seems like there is so much good tech in more mainstream cars/SUVs now that comes more standard (and therefore more affordable) - for example, almost tempted to get something like a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring Reserve AWD and save some money, which has 250 HP turbo - my concern there is it isn't a drivers car - it would meet all my other criteria but as far as handling and acceleration, although well rated in its segment, it would be a big let down from what I have now.Genesis G70 3.3T AWD Elite - this is actually one of my top alternatives that I've found; haven't tried driving one yet (it was 2019 Motortrend car of the year). It doesn't look as sexy as a Giulia... but if everything else works out I can let that slide.I know I'm all over the place, but that is because it seems that given AWD, at a reasonable price point you either have to choose between tech or performance.

Hey, I just looked up the 2020 Stinger GT1 incentives and only saw 3000 lease cash, 1500 competitive incentive, and locally 500 auto show cash = total 5000. Still pretty good. Where did you get info on 10,000 incentives, can you share? Perhaps that is combined with selling price discount? (let's talk pure incentives here...)I'll definitely check out the TLX as well, hadn't thought of that one.FYI about the question on my Giulia payment, I'll put it this way - I got a lease score of 9.5 years, which means my average payment cost would have taken at that rate 9.5 years to pay the MSRP. That's fairly decent for a lease...Also, any thoughts on the Infiniti Q50/Q60? been a while since I looked at those. ",Posts: 9,Member

The Q50 has a lot of features but seems a bit dated at this point, and some people don’t like the ride/handling I think. But, certainly worth trying to see if you like it. Good deals for sure on those. ","Posts: 44,762",Member

Coming off a Mazda CX-5 AWD Grand Touring lease and while I have loved this car it's time for something new. At first I wanted something with better gas mileage (was getting 26 with the Mazda) - but I've driven all the hybrids and don't really like any of them. Now I want to get into a luxury midsize crossover - I've driven the Lexus NX (too loud), Volvo, BMW, Mercedes GLC (bad dealer experience). I've ruled out the Acura RDX (just didn't like), Audi Q5 (stiff and uncomfortable) and Infinity QX50 (poor gas mileage and visibility).I think its down to BMW X3 xDrive 30i or the Volvo XC60 T5 or T6 Inscription - I've driven both - liked the BMW slightly better from a driving mechanics (didn't drive the Volvo T6 which I've heard is better), but I liked the Volvo interior comfort.I like my car to have all the safety features and bells & whistles. Seems to me the Volvo is better in this regard, while you can get it on the BMW its all added on and drives up the price. Plus I understand you can't get remote start on the BMW - thats a necessity in the Northeast (although not this winter).Really would love to hear your pros and cons of each vehicle to help me make a decision.

you covered a lot of it. I recently got an RDX after driving the BMW and Volvo too. They are all very nice, and just have a bit different flavor. They all are well equipped and have safety features, but BMW does package theirs so depending on what you want, might have to search for it.but they are all excellent so i say just drive each one and pick the one that you like best. And if you can't decide, base it on lease price!we largely got the Acura because it is my wife's car and was replacing an older RDX. We also really liked the BMW, but it was more money. I liked the Volvo a lot, and would have gotten one, but she did not like a couple of things so I did not make the final cut.Definitely between the BMW and Volvo, the Volvo aces the safety and interior aspects, while the BMW is more of a sporting drive.

500 miles a week x 52 weeks = about 26,000 miles a year and 260,000 over ten years.For those kind of miles I might go with a Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V. Toyota and Honda are more known for high mileage survivors that Subaru. But on the other hand, if you've liked your current Forester and haven't had significant repairs up to 160k, maybe you should reward Subaru again with your business. Another small point might be that the Subaru Forester has good rear visibility, while the RAV4 and CR-V are only so-so when it comes to rear visibility. Most SUVs have small rear windows and thick rear pillars, and that means that seeing out the back for lane changes etc. is less than ideal. Since the Forester is more a station wagon SUV it has bigger rear windows and somewhat smaller back pillars, which make for better rear visibility. ","Posts: 5,952",Member

Hello, I need an honest opinion/comparison on my next car purchase.I currently drive 2010 Subaru Forester premium. I plan to upgrade this year or , at very least , begining of next year.My 2 main choices are:A 2020 Forester SportORA 2020 RAV4 hybrid LE.The price wise they are almost the sameBut I can not make a desicion between.I like Subaru, my 2010 has been almost bulletproof for all 10 years and 158k miles. It is still in a decent shape but as a 10yo car it starting to become not as reliable as I prefere. I drive over 80miles a day so want a Little better reliability , otherwise I would keep it for another 5 or so years. A straight comparison put my 2 choices almost head to head but...Toyota has 2 main things going for it.1. A better mileage , as I am looking for hybrid2. The dealership and service department is very close to my home. Much easier maintanace and services.My Subaru dealer is about 15-20 min away so scheduling service and such is more hustle. But Forester has better visibility over all and much bigger doors to get in/outMore headroom.And higher clearance as well, not that I do much off-roading, but even in town I find better clearance helps on occasion.

I'll be looking at those two in a year or so, along with the CX-5. Right now I'm leaning towards the Rav4, I currently drive a hybrid, and even though gas prices are low I like the low gas cost and great range between fillups. You're driving lots of miles, so that's another reason to go for the hybrid. But a long test drive is needed in both, to see if each is comfortable for you. ","Posts: 9,849",Member

No kyfdx, you are thinking in terms of older hybrids.

That is latest RAV4 always AWD. The ice provides boost to the electric motor in front and power to electric motor in the back. Totally different setup comparing to hybrids 10 years ago.Even with ice it still gets 40+ mpgAnd the new prime trim rated at 90+ mpgBut it is too costly for me.Texesas, I test drove Forester. I had a loaner for 2 days. It does not difer much from my current 2010. A bit roomier, and has a bunch of new safety features which I like, but over all not that different.Now RAV4 I still need to do test drive but I will do this closer to then I am ready to buy of course.

I don't see it as an economic purchase. The hybrid version of the Rav4 is faster and smoother than the regular one, according to the reviews/tests, in addition to less gas and better range.

$400/mo for a Jetta is nuts. I pay less than that for a $42k vehicle.How many miles was your original term? Current trade is $15k-$15,250, so edmunds isn't too far off. That would put fair retail at about $17.5k-$18k. In other words, your payoff isn't anything great. It is just about right. Here is the rub, finance that $17k over 48 mos and you'll be right there at that $400 number, BUT you'll be paying for a used car soon to be out of warranty, not to mention having essentially financed the car over 7 years. Do some research on leases (read leashackr ... google it), and get yourself into another lease with 15k/yr for quite a bit less ... and don't put anything down! ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Buying miles is usually cheaper, BTW. For example, your current payment of $400/mo for 1k miles per month is 40 cents per mile. If the extra miles cost you 25 cents each, you are making out. You could look to see the current deals and if you could swap early. Unfortunately, your excess miles, remaining payments, and termination fee would add approx $80/mo to the next lease. But I suppose maybe that looks better than the $650/mo or so over the next 4 mos to cover your current payment plus miles. It is a close call, depending how you look at it. You might want to see what Carvana and Vroom would pay for it. POSSIBLY, if you get a strong offer from one of them, you could get out now for under $2k out of pocket, which would be your cheapest overall solution. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I am having trouble comparing because lots of specs have changed over the last several years on all 3. So it's hard to compare, say, a 2017 Sonata with a 2019 Altima or a 2018 Optima. I have to set up basically 12 or more comparisons to really cover everything in this group of choices. Is there an easier way to do this?Basically I am looking for the most reliable of these 3 with great mileage and good repair ratings. I'm choosing among these because it has to have a minimum 45"" leg room in the front, but not be a truck. I haven't test driven any but the Altima. So I am feeling a bit overwhelmed about choosing. My Honda Civic has 179000 miles on it so I am anxious to do something soon. Thanks in advance for any advice you might have. (cross posted with permission from a moderator.) ",Posts: 7,Member

KamCottage, these 3 all have similar MPG and reliability, but I'd favor the Sonata and Optima if only because they don't have a CVT, plus the 2015+ Sonata and 2016+ Optima are newer designs than the pre-2019 Altima. If you can afford the 2019+ Altima, that's a very nice car.I think you need to figure out what else is important to you. Be sure to drive all of them, see if you have a preference. I've driven all of them, the Altima and Sonata for a lot of miles as long-distance rentals, and they were all OK by me with excellent fuel economy for a large-ish car. If money is a factor, you can probably get a 3-4 year old Sonata or Optima for less than a similar vintage Altima. Also if you get a CPO Sonata and Optima, you get the 10-year powertrain warranty. (A plus for the 3 cars you're looking at is that they offer at least 45"" of front leg room, which you said you need, vs. more like 42"" for the Camry of 3-4 years ago.) ","Posts: 18,946",Member

Thank you backy. Since I first posted this question, I've come to realize, as mcdawgg said above, that I want a Toyota or Honda because of the reliability. I am just so damn used to longevity in all my cars that I think anything less would make me unhappy in the long run. I don't have the patience or money to repair stuff anymore than I have to... and since I have driven beaters into the ground, I don't care about aesthetics as much as durability. That said if no Toyota or Honda is a good fit for the husband than we will look at an Optima CPO. We're heading to Carmax today to just get in a bunch of cars and see what kind of room there is in the front driver seat for him, 6 foot 4, and me who will be the main driver. ",Posts: 7,Member

Hands down, Toyota if the best long-term reliability is your main goal. Well, Lexus, but it's just a more fancy Toyota. Honda is stiil good, but not as good as Toyota, especially since 2016. ","Posts: 1,712",Member

So we're talking specifically about this survey, right?https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/how-asian-domestic-european-automakers-rank-for-car-reliability/I can't view the results, of course. I'm curious to know if they state how many of a particular brand they were able to survey. In their FAQ, they say an average of 200-300 per model per year x20 yrs. They received 329,000 in 2020. That would break down to 66 models. Honda and Toyota alone have 28 (not counting submodels like Prius Prime or Accord Hybrid). What can I say? I'm a stats guy. It makes me curious. On the surface, it would seem even CR's data is extremely limited. I mean, how many responses did they get for, say, the Optima? Probably a few. What about less common vehicles? Like maybe the Ghibli? Stelvio? You get what I mean. I've also mentioned many times before, IMHO, CR is for appliance people, so it will skew toward appliance vehicles since they only survey their subscribers. I would think they have a very low subscriber base who are Jaguar owners, for example. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

I'll guess they survey more Accord owners than all Jaguar models combined. How are you ever going to get meaningful data from a make that sells so few cars?Name one other organization that actually compiles data or surveys, long term. I don't think there are any.  It's fashionable to crap on Consumer Reports, but they have science on their side, unlike others, such as JD Power that just exist to sell advertising. And, they are open about it. Even without a subscription, you found out they surveyed 329K owners, just last year. I haven't subscribed in a long time, but they've been doing it for over 50 years. Of course, you could always ask the salesperson at the dealership..  ","Posts: 203,030",Moderator

Oh, you can't. But that's my point when folks throw old thinking around like ""Honda and Toyota are the only reliable cars."" It just isn't that simple. I would say HyunKia are just as reliable these days. Do I have proof? Nope. But nobody has proof to say otherwise. That's all I'm getting at. ","Posts: 30,400",Member

Did you get a car yet? If not and are still considering the Optima, JD Power just ranked the 2018 Optima the #1 mid-sized car in its latest Vehicle Dependability Study. And Kia was the highest-ranked mass-market brand overall, behind only Lexus and Porsche. FYI the 2018 Sonata was the #2 mid-sized car.https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-us-vehicle-dependability-study-vds ","Posts: 18,946",Member

I am doing major research in trying to find my new car, which I am more leaning towards an SUV. Since I recently moved to Washington state and having to deal with snow, I will need a car that I can drive in snow without issues. I am also looking for somewhat good mileage and really good cargo space. I have only three cars I'm looking for that I am interested in which are the Subaru Outback, Toyota RAV4 hybrid, and the Subaru Forester. Which of these would you all recommend or if there are any others that sound just as good. The optimal price range is below $35,000. ",Posts: 6,Member
